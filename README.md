## How do I edit?
1. Make sure you have [Python 3](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/).
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), if you haven't already.
3. Install [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
4. Of course, [git](https://medium.com/@brlewis/start-using-gitlab-on-osx-52be5243fcc) is required.
