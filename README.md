## How do I edit?
Make sure you have [Python 3](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/).
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), if you haven't already.
Install [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
Of course, [git](https://medium.com/@brlewis/start-using-gitlab-on-osx-52be5243fcc) is required.
