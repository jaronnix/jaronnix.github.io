Pathware Inc.’s competition can be broken down into four general categories: No Quality Assessment, Manual Quality Assessment, Tele-pathology, and Whole Slide Scanning. 

### No Assessment
No tissue quality assessment makes up most of the market. A majority of biopsies take place in more remote, outpatient settings where cytopathologists are not available to assess the quality of the sample before the patient leaves.

When the cost of providing a cytotechnologist or pathologist on-site during the procedure is prohibitive, most clinics send samples to pathologists without assessment. This makes them ineligible for  [Reimbursement & Price Modeling](https://www.notion.so/Reimbursement-Price-Modeling-f60c61f975b24492924c0ac1e30b6cd0) for the assessment procedure itself and susceptible to losing money if the procedure needs to be repeated.

!!! caution "Disadvantages" 
    The primary drawback to this method is that 20% of these procedures must be repeated, causing delays in diagnoses and with the cost of the additional procedure(s) being ineligible for [Reimbursement & Price Modeling](https://www.notion.so/Reimbursement-Price-Modeling-f60c61f975b24492924c0ac1e30b6cd0)

### Manual Assessment
Mobile lab carts allow a pathologist to attend the procedure and assess the tissue’s quality at the time of its collection. These carts are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process significantly increases procedure time resulting in lost time for both the surgeon and pathologist’s valuable billing time.

    #### Milestone SRL
    Developers of the roseSTATION, a mobile lab cart system. Use of this system requires a pathologist or cytopathologist to be physically present to evaluate the slide after each pass.

    Located in `Milan, Italy`

    ??? caution "Disadvantages"
        With 4-5 passes required per biopsy, this additional step adds approximately 50 minutes to each procedure and requires the added cost of the pathologist or cytopathologist's time. Additionally, the cost of setting up a mobile pathology lab station can range from $75k-$200k.

### Tele-pathology
Larger hospitals employ tele-pathology tools to keep their pathologist in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for assessment remotely. While this saves the time of the pathologist in transit, it does not address the challenges of the manual assessment as it requires even more time and people to implement. Furthermore, remote assessments are not reimbursable under the current coding scheme.

    #### Instapath
    Developed a tool to image core needle tissue biopsies for telepathology interpretation of adequacy which is currently outside of Pathware’s market. This solution provides a method for manual assessment offsite. Their core technology is reliant on a specialized operator onsite to prepare the sample and offsite pathologists for interpretation.

    Located in `Houston, TX`

    ??? caution "Disadvantages"
        Drawbacks to this solution include the cost of clinician time (8-10 minutes per sample) needed to prepare and evaluate the sample. As compared to Pathware, their pricing model is out of scope for much of Pathware's target market at $100k capital expense for the microscope, $200 per procedure in disposables, and $100 monthly subscription per user for their software.

    #### Clarapath
    Providers of high-throughput slide digitization services. Their solution provides the service of digitizing and storing large amounts of slides efficiently.

    Located in `New York, NY`

    ??? caution "Disadvantages"
        They do not provide a point-of-care device or otherwise provide slide adequacy assessment or evaluation services as a part of their product. They are a newer competitor to the marketplace and appear to be focused specifically on providing efficient workflow solutions.

!!! quote ""
    #### Mikroscan
    
    Provides a workflow solution that incorporates on-site manual slide preparation with a telepathology solution to provide remote adequacy evaluations.

    Located in `Carlsbad, CA`

    ??? caution "Disadvantages"
        This adds 45 minutes to the workflow during a biopsy procedure. Image acquisition requires approximately 10 minutes. This solution still requires the time of a pathologist or cytotechnologist to prepare, stain, and evaluate the slide for adequacy.

!!! quote ""
    #### Hologic

    Manufacturer of ThinPrep Pap Test, which is an end-to-end diagnostic solution for pap smears. This includes a liquid-based preparation kit for clinicians to preserve cell samples from pap smears at the point of care for further analysis at the path lab. For pathology labs, Hologic produces an automatic slide-preparation machine that is compatible with its liquid-based vials, and a diagnostic imager that flags cell clusters of interest for a pathologist to make a diagnosis. In the United States, ThinPrep is the standard product for the preparation and analysis of pap smears.

    Located in `Marlborough, MA`

    ??? caution "Disadvantages"
        This solution does not provide adequacy evaluations or the ability to scan and store slides and is applicable only to pap smear samples. Additionally, the equipment is massive and stationary in the laboratory keeping them from integrating at the point-of-care.

### Whole Slide Imaging Systems
Whole Slide Scanning platforms are indirect competition: these technologies are laboratory-based and have no quality assessment component. These systems do not address to this market need and are well beyond the budget of most hospitals at `$1.0MM` per unit.

!!! quote ""
    #### Leica Biosystems
    
    Makers of Aperio slide scanners and currently are the market leaders for scanners, with each of their units starting at $30,000. The machines themselves can be small enough to fit on a desk, but only generate a small 15mmx15mm image to which a remote pathologist is able to view.

    Located in `Wetzlar, Germany`

    ??? caution "Disadvantages"
        By definition, this is not a "whole slide" image (WSI) as it is only 15mmx15mm (~12% of the Bioptic Unit’s field of view). Furthermore, Aperio scanners rely on a method that involves highly sensitive moving equipment to scan and digitize the slide This method not only takes longer to produce the final image, it is also only able to image samples that are extremely flat due to the razor thin focal range. This tendency to fall in and out of focus makes it incapable of imaging cytology images without employing secondary imaging measures (e.g. z-stacking) which brings an additional time cost, exponentially larger file sizes, and higher equipment costs. While Aperio does offer a unit with “real-time” viewing to pathologists, this model tends to have delayed and clunky interfaces that do not fit into the normal workflow of how pathologists view and assess samples. Additionally, Aperio does not currently offer slide assessment as part of their scanner capabilities, meaning that it would require an additional pathologist to be readily available for tissue assessment every time a tissue sample is extracted.

!!! quote ""
    #### Philips Healthcare

    Manufacturers of the first WSI scanner approved to market as a diagnostic instrument.

    Located in `Best, Netherlands`

    ??? caution "Disadvantage"   
        These scanners are physically large (taking up approximately twelve cubic feet of space and weigh more than 120 kg). Storage of slides requires the separate acquisition and set up of data storage systems that must be maintained by trained technical personnel staffed by the individual institution. The large form factor also prevents these units from being a practical point-of-care device. Scanning speeds are only as fast as 3 minutes per slide and limited to histology samples due to the limitations imposed by their line imaging techniques which is outside of the scope of Pathware’s market segment. In addition, the cost of acquiring and setting up these units is approximately $1 million per unit which is well beyond the available budget for the majority of the market.

## Competitive Advantages

??? question "What is the distinct competitive advantage?"
    **NOT A GOOD ANSWER / CHANGE NEEDED**
    The biggest competitive advantage is the versatility of the platform due to the digital slide cloud integration. In addition to the improvements, the Bioptic™ unit makes over current industry standards, it can easily develop secondary software applications that allow us to organically generate additional revenue from already established accounts. This coupled with being the first movers to this unaddressed market allows us to set the standard for future digital pathology adoption. Once fully integrated into the clinical workflow with our suite of services, all future market entrants will have to be funneled through our slide management system. This gives us ownership of the flow of information between labs and physicians. In addition to this, the experienced sales leaders lined up to bring on at the soft and full launch will provide us with the edge necessary to confirm deal closures.

??? question "What are the incentives and barriers to entry?"
    **NOT A GOOD ANSWER / CHANGE NEEDED**
    The main barriers to entry faced by Pathware Inc are brand recognition challenges, tariffs and quotas, the need for specialized patents and technology, finding qualified employees, government regulations, and quality validation. Our team plans to leverage existing relationships with established clinics and health systems to spread awareness of Bioptic™ and its functionality. Positioning our early adopting accounts as references sites that will be used to leverage as they scale into the market. The credibility of these institutions and the financial impact data that will be collected throughout the integration of the technology will prove to be invaluable assets to prove value for mass market adoption. Additionally, our team will attend trade shows and conferences (DPA, CAP, etc.) to further build brand recognition. With regards to tariffs and quotas, Bioptic™ will be priced to account for these tariffs while still being significantly less expensive than current technology solutions. Our team has already filed multiple patents and has developed device functionality for the primary market (FNA quality assessment). The Pathware team also plans to utilize current relationships within the Michigan and Washington healthcare and entrepreneurship communities to continue seeking out qualified employees that fit the company’s needs. Additionally, there are stringent government regulations placed on the classification and use of medical devices. Pathware is marketing Bioptic™ as a Class II Device that is not a diagnostic tool to avoid burdensome regulatory limitations. Lastly, quality validation of a medical device is essential to market acceptance and early adoption. Pathware has already secured accredited health systems and clinics to begin clinical validation of the product across a wide array of tissue types. Our team plans to use the results and recommendations from these institutions to reach a wider group of clinics to further validate the product.

??? question "What prevents a competitor from responding or imitating?"
    **NOT A GOOD ANSWER / CHANGE NEEDED**
    The threat of a new entry in the near term is relatively low due to technical, regulatory, and Intellectual Property barriers in place and the niche nature of the market. Specifically, Pathware has worked with multiple law firms to ensure the claims in our filings are robust and protectable. However, we recognize that it is reasonable to expect competitors to enter the market space once the opportunity is highlighted as they begin generating significant traction in 2021/2022. The technical challenges of developing a similar unit are not insurmountable by a well-funded engineering team and the regulatory burden is relatively low as a laboratory instrument. We plan to continue expanding our IP portfolio, but there is a significant amount of legal room in the space being that the technique is less than five years old with very few patents on record. That being the case, the goal is to saturate the market with the Bioptic™ as quickly and efficiently as possible as hospitals are reluctant to change unless there is a magnitude of improvement over the current technique that they are using. Furthermore, incorporating additional indications for the use of the platform to cement our position in the hospital while expanding revenue opportunities.
