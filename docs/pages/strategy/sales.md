The marketing plan for Pathware’s Bioptic™ unit is built on completion of winter 2020 beta trials. At product launch, the per month sales and marketing budget will be $30,000 in Mar. 2020 and climb steadily in proportion to revenue of $4.1MM by the end of 2023. Specifically, we will start by targeting the Director of the Department of Pathology in larger academic Cancer Centers will provide key opinion pieces (literature, key studies, leading journal articles) along with Trade show speaking events to ignite a marketing drive in the industry. These thought-leading institutions will provide the certification of the Bioptic™ workflow efficiency and show patient overall satisfaction increases with positive outcomes. As the company grows a hybrid sales force (inside and outside) aim to establish accounts with relationships with at least 15 Cancer Centers. Then address 1,500 CoC Accredited Cancer Centers and 4,000 community hospitals and private practices. By 2022, Pathware Inc.’s goal is to have established a partnership with a private clinical laboratory such as Quest Diagnostics to standardize biopsy collection in smaller institutions and outpatient clinics. Once established in the US Market, expansion plans take aim at international markets by integrating into South Korean hospitals ($243MM opportunity). Then expansion into additional Asian and European markets with a team consisting of extensive life science and medical device sales experience.

The initial positioning of the unit as a decision support tool as opposed to a diagnostic tool is critical for initial adoption by institutions and clinicians. Rather than replacing the pathologist in the room, Pathware’s message will be to support the diagnostic workflow by providing higher quality samples and enabling the pathologist to focus efforts towards more lucrative and impactful lab-based diagnostic tests. Secondarily, this non-diagnostic position means that the data handled by the Bioptic™ unit is lower risk information. Further, the unidirectional push of information to the EHR should present a decreased exposure for the IT infrastructure of the institution.

Access to hospitals and healthcare facilities purchasing decision makers is very complicated to accomplish with many barriers from federal legislation on money spent to influence, and the facilities own hierarchy (firewall) systems. Once beta trials are completed and data collected providing validity to ROI models, adoption workflow process, and value proposition to hospitals, Rodger Moore, current VP of Sales at Philips Healthcare has agreed to come on full time as VP of Sales. His experience in this sector will be incredibly valuable to the company and the plan is for him to familiarize himself and test the product sales process in full. The goal for Rodger is to pursue at least fifteen health institutions as the companies first sales and marketing professional. Specifically, they will target the Director of the Department of Pathology in larger academic Cancer Centers to purchase the Bioptic™. These initial accounts are targeted as they are thought-leading institutions who have an interest in having pathology assessments performed onsite. In 2020, the goal is to hire three healthcare proven sales associates to their outside sales division to establish accounts with at least 15 Cancer Centers. The plan will then overlay 10 inside sales representatives to reach the 1,500 CoC Accredited Cancer Centers and 4,000 community hospitals and private practices. By 2022, Pathware Inc’s goal is to have established a partnership with a private clinical laboratory such as Quest Diagnostics to standardize biopsy collection in smaller institutions and outpatient clinics. These accounts have fewer decision makers resulting in a significantly shorter sales cycle of two months.

### Initial Launch

1. Identify a Clinician Champion

    Pathware Inc. is in the process of identifying clinicians that can best support the need for biopsy quality assessment and will work with them to identify and create journal studies showing major support for the addition of this technology into the pathology setting. This, in turn, will garner support from the decision makers at their institutions. These physicians need to understand and support the clinical value that Bioptic™ brings to their institutions and practice. These champions will likely fall into the following profiles.

    In Order of Preference:

    +  Director of Cytopathology (ex: [Liron Pantanowitz, MD](https://path.upmc.edu/personnel/Faculty/Pantanowitz.htm))
    +  Director of Pathology (ex: [David Chhieng, MD](http://www.pathology.washington.edu/faculty/chhieng))
    +  Director of Radiology (ex: [Sam Gambhir, MD](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/sanjiv-gambhir?tab=bio))

2. Evaluation Phase

    Larger hospitals have Value Committees that review major purchasing decisions at their institution. They are typically made up of one or more of the following personnel: Purchasing, Quality, Patient Satisfaction, Biomedical Engineering, IT. Their decision to purchase is based on the clinical, financial, and operational benefit of a product. By having the clinical support of a department chair and pricing the unit well below the purchase threshold that these committees are typically presented with, they should be able to secure contracts relatively quickly compared to the industry average.

    Medium sized hospitals, the evaluation, and purchasing decision will likely be in the hands of the department chair since the price point would easily fit into their operational budget rather than a capital expense. They would likely need to see adoption at other institutions first as they are risk-averse.

    Smaller hospitals may have a diverse committee of 4-5 that reviews all purchase contracts for their facility. Due to their size, they will likely be able to move faster than their larger counterparts. Their evaluation typically revolves around the financial outcomes of the purchasing decision.

3. Adoption & Integration

    This process will largely vary based on institutional protocols and personnel. The initial product will be basic in nature and will not interact with the EHR allowing the integration to be relatively streamlined. Detailed onsite training for the first 15 accounts and virtual demonstrations, online training modules pre-launch of the inside sales/support division and scale into the market space.

    Pathware has prepared a detailed and scalable sales protocol that is outlined below. Phase I of this outline began October 2020 with Phase III beginning January 2021.

Further, the unidirectional push of information to the EHR should present a decreased exposure for the IT infrastructure of the institution.

- What are the market size, growth, and rate of growth?

    Primarily the 3.3M Fine Needle Aspiration biopsies are the focus in the US market for Bioptic™. This market represents 4,840 community hospitals, 1,500 cancer centers as well as academic and research institutions leading to $443M in unit sales (assuming 3.5 units per account). With an average of $200 of revenue generated from each biopsy procedure and $20k per Bioptic™ unit, this collection represents a $1.4B annuity-based market opportunity. Initially, efforts focus on thyroid biopsies ($156M) due to the relatively low clinical risk and clear market pull for this application. Once established in the thyroid biopsy market, expansion into other tissues such as breast ($325M) and lung ($310M). The technology will then be deployed for lymph node, liver, pancreatic, and GI biopsies ($570M). The planned start with lung cancer is Q1 of 2020 followed by breast cancer in Q2 2020. We plan to rapidly expand into these adjacent segments because these biopsies are performed by the same departments with similar needs to the initial thyroid application. With plans for international expansion, the global market opportunity totals $3.6B, based on the current FNA procedure volume (5% CAGR).

    Pathware’s total Addressable Market amounts to $12.8B based on FNA usage across global market spaces. Progress towards this total opportunity is achieved by first focusing on the North American region due to proximity and networks already in place. Pathware Inc. is in discussions with seasoned international sales personnel in the life science industry to streamline our expansion into the European and Asian market spaces. To effectively saturate these markets while maintaining the first-mover advantage, a plan to raise a Series B and Series C of $12M and $25M respectively over the next five years is in place. Both these rounds will be at a stage where the company is post profitability enabling more favorable terms for growth and late stage capital.

    As a general trend, the market is moving in the direction of digital pathology with an estimated $1B in 2018 sales. The Digital Pathology Market is projected to reach $8.66B with a [14.8% CAGR by 2023](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-pathology-market-to-reach-8-66-bn-globally-by-2023-at-14-8-cagr-says-allied-market-research-895573616.html).

    Moreover, collaboration in the medical space will continue its shift toward a virtual environment from a physical one particularly as the number of pathologists, globally, continue to shrink. Pathware believes that this will represent a shift into the Telemedicine market which was valued at $26.5B in 2018 and will [exceed $41B by 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/671374/global-telemedicine-market-size/).

- Current Customers & Revenue

    As is common with an early medical device in an exploratory setting, we have outlined our current pilot/beta test subjects and identified them as key to the development of the Bioptic™ validity in the pathology cytology workflow to attain adequate sample data the first time, every time.

- Customer and partner interviews

    Through the customer and industry discovery phase that included interviewing more than 200 recognized clinicians, Pathology thought leaders, and medical professionals across the country, Pathware Inc. learned that there is an immediate need for a device with the capabilities of Bioptic™. With the initial presentation of the product idea, an immediate value was recognized. By far the most mentioned aspect was how much time would be saved for both patient and pathologists, with many of them making mention that being present for quality assessment was not an effective use of their billable time. Several radiologists that were part of the discovery discussed how each pathologist will have a different quantity of passes they will request for each biopsy, to help stave off the possibility of a sample quality issue, a problem that Bioptic™ addresses. A direct quote from Mark Cohen, professor of Surgery and Pharmacology at the University of Michigan Health System “Having worked with Pathware’s CEO, Michael Moore, over the past few years, the team has undergone rigorous efforts including NSF’s, I-CORPS, and VentureWell programming to validate the need for their technology in the healthcare space. I feel this technology carries great potential clinical merit and am in complete support of evaluating it clinically to determine its benefits to patients and workflow efficiencies.”

- Positioning/Niche

    The initial niche is the digital cytology quality assessment. As such, a strong emphasis needs to be placed on positioning Bioptic™ as a device complementary to existing pathologist workflow. It creates unique value over current solutions and integrates with established pathologist and clinician practices. This provides a unique position for Pathware Inc. as once Bioptic™ has been adopted, it can be constantly improved via software updates to increase adoption and functionality. With platform technology, it can perform quality and assessment to many secondary markets (via other tissues) while building a valuable repository from the tissue data collected by Bioptic™. Altogether, the technology allows them to establish a low-cost gold standard for automated quality assessment.

- International Sales Process

    [International Distributor Flow Chart.pdf](Sales%20and%20Marketing%20798fea689f844dddb24b53382092ca8e/International_Distributor_Flow_Chart.pdf)

- Promotional Budget & Pricing

    At launch, the per month sales and marketing budget will be $30,000 in Oct. 2019 and climb steadily in proportion to revenue of $9MM by the end of 2023. During this, they plan to take the product from a research-based platform to a commercially and clinically viable tool and focus less on passive marketing and more aggressive techniques such as in-person conferences and targeted advertising.

    Initial marketing activities will focus on key areas discussed below:

    - **Trade shows**

        Attendance at industry trade shows to spread awareness of products and connect with potential consumers

    - **Thought leaders/Pathology champions**

        Identify Key opinion leaders to provide dinner programs education seminars/round tables at trade shows, conferences, and local seminars.

    - **Industry professional testimony**

        Utilize testimony from industry professionals that participated in clinical trials and early adoption in marketing material and literature.

    - **Literature ads**

        A recurring round of marketing material will be run in medical journals in Q3 as they enter the market

    - **SEO optimization**

        Search Engine Optimization utilizing both internal and external sources to ensure the correct results are visible through search aggregators and those looking for additional information

    - **Social media presence**

        Hand in hand with the SEO optimization, a focus on social media consistency keeping Pathware relevant in the new age of digital media.

    To reiterate, the Bioptic™ unit will be listed at $20,000 (25% volume discount will be offered) giving a 70% margin when factoring in the discount, 90-day full return policy from the date of sale. Once in place, the service of sample assessment will cost $10 per slide scanned to the hospital. Scanning requires no additional resources. Given a reimbursement of $69.21 per pass and an average of 4.5 passes per biopsy, the machine will generate positive revenue for the institution after around 80 biopsy procedures under this pricing strategy.

- Location

    Pathware Inc. offices are split between two US locations: Seattle, Washington, and Ann Arbor, Michigan. Both offices are open offices and co-working spaces that offer flexibility for scaling rapidly as their business expands.

    ### Ann Arbor

    > A vibrant town buoyed by the academic prowess of the University of Michigan; Ann Arbor is a short drive from a major international airport, providing easy access to the clinical validation partners, primarily based in the East Coast and Midwest. Life Science is a main staple of the midwestern startup scene, which has enabled Pathware to thrive with supportive grants and a vast network of medical resources readily available.

    The Business Development is located in Ann Arbor due to the proximity to their pilot clinical sites (Michigan Medicine, Henry Ford Health System, UPMC) and ease of access to the major international airport of DTW. Additionally, Ann Arbor has served as the basecamp for Pathware from day one by fostering development through state sponsored grants and its vast network of life science mentors. Throughout the early stages of development it is critical to maintain regular communication and develop professional relationships with the physician champions at the pilot institutions to ensure that our clinical studies are able to successfully flow into early adopters and reference accounts. This office’s focus is on building strong relationships with their initial accounts and making inroads within the entrepreneurial and investment ecosystems to support future growth.

    ### Seattle

    > An enormous technology center in the Pacific Northwest whose only rival in the software boom of the past two decades is Silicon Valley; Seattle provides the necessary tech sector and work-life balance to attract their software and related product and service development needs.

    Pathware’s Technology Development Center located in Seattle, at the epicenter for machine learning and home to a booming software industry. This is strategically located to provide access to skilled workers with the need of technical development for primary assessment algorithm and expansion into developing algorithms for secondary diagnosis/assessment of other aspects (i.e. beyond FNA adequacy assessment). Seattle is a key R&D location for potential partners such as Philips Healthcare. The city is also home to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and the University of Washington, all of which service patients from Alaska to across the Pacific Northwest. The plan is to assemble the initial units in Seattle until agreements are in place for scaling operations with a contract manufacturer.

- 24-Month Sales Forecast

    Pathware inc. plans on launching Bioptic™ to selected research partners in March 2020, producing initial revenue of $20,000 in readers and $16,800 in assessment charges. This successful soft launch will put Pathware on schedule to sell 430 units by end of 2021, having been reimbursed for more than 700,000 assessments and generating $41MM in combined revenue. See the Pathware Financial Model for more detail.
