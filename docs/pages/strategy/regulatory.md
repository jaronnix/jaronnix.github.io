# Regulatory Approach

## Pathware Regulatory Assumptions

- Reach the market quickly with a product that offers value without substantial regulatory overhead
- Increase label claims through software-only feature updates of system
- US market first, EU/China and ROW to follow later

## Phase 1 - Automated ROSE system

**Intended Use:** The Bioptic System is an automated system used for the rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of cytological specimens to determine sample adequacy

**Indications for Use:** The Bioptic System is indicated for use with thyroid tissue taken via fine-needle aspiration biopsy procedure. The Bioptic System is indicated for use with slides that are unstained. The Bioptic System is indicated for use in point-of-care settings. The Bioptic System is not intended for the analysis of frozen sections, histological, or non-cytological tissue specimens. This Bioptic System is not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease

**Regulatory Path** - Direct De Novo Submission as there are no equivalent predicates. 

**Regulatory Classification** - Class I (general controls)

**Rationale**: Indications for use are expanded to include new tissue types such as breast, lung, pap, etc. as well as with Pathware's glass slides. Each new indication falls under existing general intended use statement and is considered a class I device, subject to general controls. The image capture module, a component of the system, is developed and tested under design control and in compliance to relevant WSI special controls to ensure it is reusable in phase 2. 

## Phase 2 - Cytology Whole Slide Imaging System

After reaching the market with automated ROSE systems, Pathware can expand the device functionality allowing for the viewing and management of digital biopsy slides. Sample viewing and the web-based portal can be added to the system in order to streamline clinic workflows and allow the pathologist to make diagnoses off the images based on their clinical expertise. The below regulatory statements are proposed:

**Intended Use:** The Bioptic Cytology WSI System is a digital slide creation, viewing, staining, and management system. The Bioptic Cytology WSI system is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist to review and interpret digital images of cytological slides.

**Indications for Use:**  The Bioptic Cytology WSI System is indicated for use with unstained slides. The Bioptic Cytology WSI System is indicated for use with specimens taken from Fine Needle Aspiration biopsy procedures. The Bioptic Cytology WSI System is indicated for use in digitally simulating Diff-Quik stains. The Bioptic System is not intended for use with frozen sections, histological, or non-cytological tissue specimens. 

**Regulatory Path** - Direct De Novo Submission as there are no equivalent predicates. 

**Regulatory Classification** - Class II (general controls, special controls)

**Rationale:** The current WSI systems are for histological use only, not cytological. Additionally, there are no predicate digital staining devices. By including digital staining in the labelling, any competitor that wants to be a predicate would have to replicate digital staining as well. Pathware to expand indications and move into other digital stains as well as eventually cross over to Histology Whole Slide imaging, which would be a 510k with device type PSY.

## Phase 3 - Web-based Computational Pathology

Finally, Pathware should further improve on the Bioptic Web-Based Portal to offer innovative AI-based solutions that empowers pathologists to improve how they make diagnostic decisions off of the digital images. This would increase diagnostic accuracy and precision while enabling the pathologist to deliver precision medicine that will improve patient outcomes. The following regulatory statements are proposed:

**Intended Use:** Bioptic Web Portal is a picture archiving and a communication system capable of analyzing and interpreting digital images of pathology slides.

**Indications for Use:** The Bioptic Web Portal consists of web-based software and is indicated for analyzing images acquired from a whole slide image acquisition system. The Bioptic Web Portal specifically analyzes cytological fine needle aspiration biopsies. It provides clinically-relevant data to support qualified pathologists or other licensed professional healthcare practitioners for clinical-decision making.

**Regulatory Path:** 510k (predicate K163253)

**Regulatory Classification:** Class II

**Rationale:**
