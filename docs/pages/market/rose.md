In an effort to reduce the need for repeat procedures, physicians have turned to rapid, on-site evaluation (ROSE). Two main methods of ROSE currently exist: manual quality assessment and telepathology. Manual quality assessment has been attempted by companies such as Milestone, who has created mobile lab carts to allow the pathologist to come to the procedure and assess the tissue’s quality at the time of its collection. Larger hospitals use telepathology tools such as Mikroscan to keep their pathologists in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for remote assessment.

    The advantages of ROSE service are primarily driven by goals of improved personalized care and better outcomes for patients. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, the American Society of Cytopathology supports the availability and use of a rapid on‐site evaluation (ROSE) service provided by pathologists and experienced cytotechnologists for FNA and selected core biopsy.

ROSE of FNA biopsies significantly reduces the need for repeat procedures, making it an effective solution to this issue.[^15] However, current ROSE technologies are not cost-effective, timely, or user-friendly. The carts manufactured by Milestone are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process increases procedure time by approximately 50 minutes. Additionally, the cost of setting up a mobile pathology lab station can range from $75k-$200k.[^16] Products similar to those manufactured by Mikroscan may save pathologist transit times but they do not address the challenges of manual assessments, as they require even more time and people to implement.[^17]

Regardless of technological merits, ROSE solutions that involve physician labor face the hurdle that is a growing pathologist shortage in the United States.[^18] A country already strained by diagnostic demand cannot be expected to also produce the second set of resources needed to evaluate biopsy adequacy.
