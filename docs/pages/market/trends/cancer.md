# Cancer Trends

In 2019 in the U.S., there will be an estimated 1,762,450 new cancer cases and 606,880 cancer deaths.[^1] Of specific relevance to the technologies being developed by Pathware Inc. are cancers of the thyroid, lung, pancreas, and breast. Our pathology solutions have the greatest potential to decrease mortality and increase five year survival rates associated with these cancers.
