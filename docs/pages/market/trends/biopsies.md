# Biopsy Trends

The failure rate of fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies is one of our most compelling value propositions. 1 in 5 FNA biopsies fails to make a diagnosis. These failed diagnoses mean that hospitals are required to repeat the procedure at an expense of $3000 per biopsy. Nearly $2.5B is spent annually by US hospitals repeating FNA biopsies.
