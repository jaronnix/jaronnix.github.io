# Physician Trends

The United States experienced a 17% decline in the pathologist workforce from 2007 to 2017 equating to a 42% increase in individual workloads.[^1] On a global scale, >50% of the world's pathologists are located within the United States[^2] which contains only 4% of the global population. Pathware Inc. seeks to address these shortages through digital pathology solutions that will create more efficient diagnostic workflows.
