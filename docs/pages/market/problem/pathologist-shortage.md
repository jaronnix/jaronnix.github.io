Pathologists are becoming increasingly scarce assets in nations around the globe while the burden of cancer still weighs heavy. Pathware seeks to address this growing global shortage of pathologists through the development of software and hardware solutions to simplify digital pathology workflows.

The United States experienced a 17% decline in the pathologist workforce from 2007 to 2017 equating to a 42% increase in individual workloads.[^1] Recent [surveys](https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2020-lifestyle-burnout-6012460?src=WNL_physrep_200115_burnout2020&uac=347237MG&impID=2245484&faf=1#1) are beginning to illustrate the severity of burnout that such workloads cause, with 36% of pathologists reporting "long-term, unresolvable job-related stress that leads to exhaustion, cynicism, and feelings of detachment." On a global scale, >50% of the world's pathologists are located within the United States which contains only 4% of the global population.[^2] Low-income countries such as Zimbabwe or Mozambique report single-digit numbers of pathologists despite populations exceeding 13 million and 24 million, respectively.[^3]

Meanwhile, cancer remains the second leading cause of death worldwide. The role of the pathologist is inextricably linked to cancer. When malignancies are suspected, a biopsy is taken for evaluation and ultimately ends up in the hands of a pathologist who renders a final diagnosis. In 2017, the United States and the world logged record numbers for populations living with cancer, 22.86 and 100.48 million people respectively.[^4] While these numbers are partly due to an increasing population, the numbers of pathologists are not growing at a proportional rate. In fact, the number of pathologists leaving the workforce is actually outpacing new additions.[^5] This trend is predicted to continue until at least 2030 and likely beyond.
