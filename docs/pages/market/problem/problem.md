Every tissue sample, whether a biopsy or bacterial culture, must pass through the hands of a pathologist to reach a diagnosis. The number of pathologists globally continues to decline, placing a greater burden on an already strained field. Due to the limited bandwidth of pathologists, onsite services to verify the quality of the samples being collected are typically bypassed in favor of higher priority and more lucrative work done in the pathology lab. This lack of on-site services means that tissue samples are sent to testing laboratories before being assessed for adequacy. As a result, 20-25% of biopsy cases will be deemed inadequate for diagnostic testing and an additional sample will be required.[^1] In these situations, a patient must be readmitted for a repeated biopsy, costing the hospital $3,100 that is unable to be reimbursed. With 3.3M biopsies taken annually in the US, more than $2B lost every year. This costly issue is avoidable if the physician is able to have the biopsy’s quality assessed during the procedure, before the patient is discharged.

## A Shrinking Workforce
Pathologists are becoming increasingly scarce assets in nations around the globe while the burden of cancer still weighs heavy. Pathware seeks to address this growing global shortage of pathologists through the development of software and hardware solutions to simplify digital pathology workflows.

The United States experienced a 17% decline in the pathologist workforce from 2007 to 2017 equating to a 42% increase in individual workloads.[^1] Recent [surveys](https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2020-lifestyle-burnout-6012460?src=WNL_physrep_200115_burnout2020&uac=347237MG&impID=2245484&faf=1#1) are beginning to illustrate the severity of burnout that such workloads cause, with 36% of pathologists reporting "long-term, unresolvable job-related stress that leads to exhaustion, cynicism, and feelings of detachment." On a global scale, >50% of the world's pathologists are located within the United States which contains only 4% of the global population.[^2] Low-income countries such as Zimbabwe or Mozambique report single-digit numbers of pathologists despite populations exceeding 13 million and 24 million, respectively.[^3]

Meanwhile, cancer remains the second leading cause of death worldwide. The role of the pathologist is inextricably linked to cancer. When malignancies are suspected, a biopsy is taken for evaluation and ultimately ends up in the hands of a pathologist who renders a final diagnosis. In 2017, the United States and the world logged record numbers for populations living with cancer, 22.86 and 100.48 million people respectively.[^4] While these numbers are partly due to an increasing population, the numbers of pathologists are not growing at a proportional rate. In fact, the number of pathologists leaving the workforce is actually outpacing new additions.[^5] This trend is predicted to continue until at least 2030 and likely beyond.

## Point-of-Care Failures

The fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure used to collect a small amount of tissue for cytopathological evaluation. FNAB is widely regarded as the preferred biopsy method for thyroid nodules[^6] and is becoming an increasingly valued method for bronchial, pancreatic, lymphatic, and oral tissue as well.[^7] In the United States in 2016, 2,837,898 FNA biopsies were taken accounting for 15% of all biopsies.[^8] By the year 2040, we expect this number to climb to over 6.7 million. Advancements in imaging techniques such as ultrasound guidance have coincided with this substantial rise in FNAB adoption by improving both safety and procedural accuracy.[^9]

Unfortunately, FNABs frequently fail to provide a satisfactory tissue sample for an off-site pathologist to render a diagnosis.

### Hospital Revenue Loss
A review of the literature suggests that as many as 27% of original FNABs are deemed inadequate and the evaluating pathologist is unable to provide a diagnosis.[^10] An FNAB may be deemed inadequate for a variety of reasons, including limited cellularity, no follicular cells, or poor fixation and preservation.[^11] A failure to diagnose means that 1 in 5 patients will have to return for a repeat procedure, a non-refundable hospital expense. The failure rate for repeat procedures has been shown to even higher, as much as 62%`.[^12]

Under the current reimbursement schema, a first-time FNA biopsy can be reimbursed at a rate of $415.46.[^13] If necessary, a second, non-reimbursable FNAB costs a hospital $3000/procedure which translates to an average of $1.2M in losses per hospital annually.[^14] Nationwide, $1.2/hospital means that a total of $1.9B is lost each year to failed FNA biopsies.

### Rapid On-site Evaluation
In an effort to reduce the need for repeat procedures, physicians have turned to rapid, on-site evaluation (ROSE). Two main methods of ROSE currently exist: manual quality assessment and telepathology. Manual quality assessment has been attempted by companies such as Milestone, who has created mobile lab carts to allow the pathologist to come to the procedure and assess the tissue’s quality at the time of its collection. Larger hospitals use telepathology tools such as Mikroscan to keep their pathologists in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for remote assessment.

!!! quote "American Society of Cytopathology"   
    The advantages of ROSE service are primarily driven by goals of improved personalized care and better outcomes for patients. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, the American Society of Cytopathology supports the availability and use of a rapid on‐site evaluation (ROSE) service provided by pathologists and experienced cytotechnologists for FNA and selected core biopsy.

ROSE of FNA biopsies significantly reduces the need for repeat procedures, making it an effective solution to this issue.[^15] However, current ROSE technologies are not cost-effective, timely, or user-friendly. The carts manufactured by Milestone are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process increases procedure time by approximately 50 minutes. Additionally, the cost of setting up a mobile pathology lab station can range from $75k-$200k.[^16] Products similar to those manufactured by Mikroscan may save pathologist transit times but they do not address the challenges of manual assessments, as they require even more time and people to implement.[^17]

Regardless of technological merits, ROSE solutions that involve physician labor face the hurdle that is a growing pathologist shortage in the United States.[^18] A country already strained by diagnostic demand cannot be expected to also produce the second set of resources needed to evaluate biopsy adequacy.
