The fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure used to collect a small amount of tissue for cytopathological evaluation. FNAB is widely regarded as the preferred biopsy method for thyroid nodules[^6] and is becoming an increasingly valued method for bronchial, pancreatic, lymphatic, and oral tissue as well.[^7] In the United States in 2016, 2,837,898 FNA biopsies were taken accounting for 15% of all biopsies.[^8] By the year 2040, we expect this number to climb to over 6.7 million. Advancements in imaging techniques such as ultrasound guidance have coincided with this substantial rise in FNAB adoption by improving both safety and procedural accuracy.[^9]

Unfortunately, FNABs frequently fail to provide a satisfactory tissue sample for an off-site pathologist to render a diagnosis.

## Hospital Revenue Loss
A review of the literature suggests that as many as 27% of original FNABs are deemed inadequate and the evaluating pathologist is unable to provide a diagnosis.[^10] An FNAB may be deemed inadequate for a variety of reasons, including limited cellularity, no follicular cells, or poor fixation and preservation.[^11] A failure to diagnose means that 1 in 5 patients will have to return for a repeat procedure, a non-refundable hospital expense. The failure rate for repeat procedures has been shown to even higher, as much as 62%`.[^12]

Under the current reimbursement schema, a first-time FNA biopsy can be reimbursed at a rate of $415.46.[^13] If necessary, a second, non-reimbursable FNAB costs a hospital $3000/procedure which translates to an average of $1.2M in losses per hospital annually.[^14] Nationwide, $1.2/hospital means that a total of $1.9B is lost each year to failed FNA biopsies.
