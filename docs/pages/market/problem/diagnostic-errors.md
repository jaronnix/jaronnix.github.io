# Diagnostic Errors

In a recent study conducted at Johns Hopkins University, medical error was determined to be the third most common cause of death in the United States.[^1] This analysis placed the estimated number of deaths due to medical error at more than 400,000 individuals, trailing only heart disease and cancer nationwide. The cause of such widespread error is multifaceted but it is clear that physician burnout is a major contributor. Never before have more doctors been more dissatisfied with their careers on such a broad scale and the relationship between burnout and medical error is well documented.[^2]

The economic impact of this phenomenon is significant, costing the United States $4.6B annually in expenses related to turnover and reduced clinical hours.[^4] Additionally, patients are less satisfied with the care provided by burnt-out physicians and clinical outcomes suffer.[^5]

Our team here at Pathware is particularly interested in the percentage of medical errors that are within the realm of diagnostics and laboratory medicine. Pathologists are the foundational physician subtype of laboratory medicine and their work can be classified into three main categories:

???+ tldr "Pre-analytical Pathology"
    Clinical guidance during biopsy procurement, sample preparation and tissue staining.

??? tldr "Analytical Pathology" 
    Clincal guidance during diagnostic workflows.

??? tldr "Post-analytical Pathology"
    Diagnostic interpretations rendered into decision support (e.g, predicting necessary laboratory tests).

As detailed in [Pathologist Shortage](https://investor.pathware.com/pages/problem/pathologist-shortage/), pathologist numbers are declining while physician burnout and workloads are increasing. Overworked pathologists are prone to errors in all categories of work, especially tasks within the pre-analytical phase. A meta-analysis revealed that pre-analytical error rates range between 31.8% and 68.2%.[^6]

Our Bioptic unit is designed to be placed at the point of care during the pre-analytical portion of pathology workflows. We aim to reduce the growing burdens placed on a dwindling pathologist population in order to reduce these costly errors, all while generating additional revenue for hospitals.
