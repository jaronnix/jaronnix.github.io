Pathware will generate revenue from two sources: Bioptic sales and slide assessments. The Bioptic unit will be sold to hospitals for $20,000 with a recurring charge of $45 per sample assessed. This $45/sample price is substantially lower than the potential revenues of established reimbursement codes; the operator is thereby able to generate up to $100 in revenue each time Bioptic renders an assessment. 

Pathware recognizes that multiple assessments will likely be needed to achieve a quality sample.[^1] Typically, four (4) needle 'passes' are required to sufficiently sample a lesion and company revenue is expected to average $200 per biopsy procedure. Our initial focus is on fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) assessments. Such FNAB procedures account for 1/4 of the total biopsies a hospital performs. The 2,000 FNABs that an average hospital performs annually would generate recurring revenue per hospital of $400,000 per year. Through future software upgrades, our goal is to allow customers to use the Bioptic unit for biopsy procedures other than FNA, which will generate additional streams of revenue without any hardware updates needed.

This specific business model structure that Pathware is pursuing has been dubbed Enterprise Monitoring as a Service (EMaaS). EMaaS has been growing in popularity as of late with healthcare giants Philips and Jackson Health System forging a long-term, strategic [partnership](https://www.usa.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/press/2018/20180627-philips-jackson-health-system-sign-agreement-for-enterprise-monitoring-service.html) around the model.

## Reimbursement Model

The Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) procedure is broken into three billable processes: 

`10021/10022: Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy with or without image guidance`

`88172/88177: Rapid Onsite Evaluation for Adequacy`

`88173: Final diagnosis of FNA sample` 

The biopsy (10021) and the diagnosis (88173) are billed regardless of the presence or absence of an on-site evaluation for the adequacy or what techniques were used to come to the final diagnosis (e.g. flow cytometry, cell block, etc.). However, both codes are limited in that they can only be billed for a single occurrence per nodule per month. The Rapid Onsite Evaluation for Adequacy (88172) has a total reimbursement potential from CMS of $69.21 (TC: $25.94, PC:$43.27) for the first evaluation event and $36.00 (TC: $9.55, PC: $26.45) for each additional sample collected until an adequate biopsy is collected. These codes do not have any time restrictions that would limit their ability to be billed. It is important to note that this code can only be billed if an onsite evaluation of the tissue collected from an FNA is performed. Being that most of the market (93-95%) has not implemented any technique to perform this procedure, using the Bioptic would open a new line of billing for many of the users that they were previously leaving on the table. This billable income increase coupled with the cost savings of repeated procedures reduction means a positive impact on both the top and bottom line for their client institutions.
