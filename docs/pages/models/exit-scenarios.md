Our conversations to-date indicate a post-series B exit is the most likely of the proposed scenarios. Our models have Pathware achieving a 5th-year revenue of $75MM with profits at $32.6MM, approaching a valuation over 10X total financing raised ($38MM) at approximately $400MM-$450MM.

## Pre-Series B (24 Months)

Pathware’s first opportunity for acquisition takes place just prior to the closing of a Series B round. At this stage, Pathware fits a category of acquisitions known as a [bolt-on acquisition](https://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2018/07/03/philips-looks-for-bolt-on-targets-while-cutting-costs/): this data has been gathered from a series of discussions with the international business development team for Philips Healthcare’s Digital Pathology division. Specifically, Philips mentioned that they look to acquire at 10-15 active hospital clients for $50MM-$75MM, at 8x-10x of Pathware’s revenue in 24 months.

## Post-Series B (48 Months)

Pathware’s second opportunity for exit occurs after significant traction our beachhead market: biopsy quality assessment. Evidence of traction is shown after they secure cash-flow-positive status, begin expanding globally, and start exploring secondary applications that venture into the diagnostic realm (known as biopsy triage). This the standard maturity at which Life Science companies tend to exit; as they start to compete with incumbents such as Philips, Roche, and Hologic, they prefer to purchase the technology and customer base rather than re-engineer and recapture their own. Evidenced by a number of comparable companies, described below, Pathware can reasonably expect a valuation of 6X to 8X revenue: $350MM-$450MM. An acquisition at this stage would result in more than 10X returned on all investment taken throughout the life of the company.

## Late Stage Exit (60+ Months)

An exit after 60 months from today would put Pathware in a category of acquisitions considered ‘late-stage’ compared to most life science companies. The industry standards for a post-Series C exit lead them to predict an exit revenue-multiple of between 3X and 6X, resulting in an acquisition valuation of $700MM in 2025. These later-stage exits are less frequent, but recent mergers and acquisitions have shown that companies are willing to pay significant price tags to incorporate technologies with long-term portfolio fits.
