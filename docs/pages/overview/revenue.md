We will sell the Bioptic™ unit to hospitals for $20,000 per unit with a recurring charge of $45 per sample assessed. This $45 price point is less than the $100 value of established reimbursement codes for physician-conducted sample assessment, meaning that the hospital will generate up to $55 in profit every time that they use the BiopticTM system to make an assessment. Current clinical practice shows that multiple samples will need to be assessed in order to achieve a viable biopsy (Hen Lee et al. 2015); resulting in an average revenue of $200 per biopsy procedure. Our initial focus is on Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy assessments in which a thin hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells. Such FNA procedures account for 1/4th of the total biopsies a hospital performs. The 2,000 FNA biopsies that an average hospital performs in a year would generate recurring revenue per hospital of $400,000 per year. Through software upgrades, customers will be able to use the Bioptic™ unit for biopsy procedures other than FNA which will generate additional streams of revenue without hardware updates.
