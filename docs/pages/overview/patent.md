A provisional patent protecting our automated slide smearing technology was filed through a collaboration with Aurora Consulting and Wolf Greenfield & Sacks, P.C. Our third-party patentability search demonstrated a clear patent landscape for our claims. We have obtained exclusive licensing options to patents from UCONN and UCLA to bolster protection of our ptychographic imaging and digital staining technologies. Omnibus Provisional Patents were submitted in June 2018 and December 2018, which include – Components, Methods, and Techniques for sample preparation, Image Acquisition and Software that comprise our Bioptic™ unit. Additionally, we have a signed letter from the University of Michigan stating that it does not have any ownership claims to the IP that we have developed. We have filed for trademarks protecting both “Pathware” and “Bioptic.”
