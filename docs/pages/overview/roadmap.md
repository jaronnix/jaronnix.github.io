To reach our full market opportunity, we plan to further develop in our secondary software packages to expand the utility of our device into additional markets starting in 2023. 20% of the previous yearâ€™s revenue will be allocated for the development of additional software packages to expand the utility of the platform beyond biopsy quality control by integrating diagnostic software to determine if tissue samples are benign or malignant. We will initially target tissues that are biopsied by a Fine Needle Aspiration (ex: thyroid, breast, lung) and expand into larger tissue biopsies and other modalities of sample collection such as tissue swabs, touch prep, and blood draws. Our highest priority secondary market is machine learning-based integrated with pap smear imaging. This market is currently valued at $7B and is rapidly expanding at a CAGR of 6.7%. While our full pursuit of developing this technology into our unit is slated for Q1 2023, we have recently taken the early initiative to apply for non-dilutive funding from the NIH SBIR that will support this effort. Additional secondary applications of this platform include but are not limited to infertility testing, veterinary biopsies, telepathology, surgical frozen sections, and urine blood analysis. It is important to note that we can enter each of these markets without having to alter the hardware in any way allowing for rapid expansion and added value for already established accounts.
