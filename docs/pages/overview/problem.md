Every tissue sample, whether a biopsy or bacterial culture, must pass through the hands of a pathologist to reach a diagnosis. The number of pathologists globally continues to decline, placing a greater burden on an already strained field. Due to the limited bandwidth of pathologists, onsite services to verify the quality of the samples being collected are typically bypassed in favor of higher priority and more lucrative work done in the pathology lab. This lack of on-site services means that tissue samples are sent to testing laboratories before being assessed for adequacy. As a result, 20-25% of biopsy cases will be deemed inadequate for diagnostic testing and an additional sample will be required (Journal of Otolaryngology, Le et al, 2015). In these situations, a patient must be readmitted for a repeated biopsy, costing the hospital $3,100 that is unable to be reimbursed. With 3.3M biopsies taken annually in the US, more than $2B lost every year. This costly issue is avoidable if the physician is able to have the biopsyâ€™s quality assessed during the procedure, before the patient is discharged.
