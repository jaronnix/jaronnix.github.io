## Planned Partnerships
Philips Healthcare is currently the leader in the digital pathology sector with recent acquisitions, partnerships, and a landmark FDA clearance for its whole slide imaging (WSI) platform, Intellisite. We are positioning ourselves for partnership with Philips in the next 3-5 years as we complement their current WSI efforts due to technical limitations in their Intellisite system which do not allow for the analysis of cytology samples. We have met with the global directors of Philipâ€™s Digital Pathology division, and are in regular communication as we continue to develop our product and establish market traction.

Private Clinical Labs, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, work as independent pathology laboratories for more than 3,000 hospitals. They confirmed that the failure rate of their biopsies is a concern for their business, and they fear losing their clients to competitors.
