# Pathware Executive Summary
## Our Mission
Pathware aims to become the global leader in the automated on-site cancer screening and diagnostics industry. Utilizing intuitive hardware and software that provides real-time biopsy quality assessments, pathologists can increase their efficiency of workflow without sacrificing quality care. The Bioptic™ unit provides rapid tissue imaging partnered with secure, cloud-based digital image management for easy EHR integration and hospital adoption.

### Problem
Every tissue sample, whether a biopsy or bacterial culture, must pass through the hands of a pathologist to reach a diagnosis. The number of pathologists globally continues to decline, placing a greater burden on an already strained field. Due to the limited bandwidth of pathologists, onsite services to verify the quality of the samples being collected are typically bypassed in favor of higher priority and more lucrative work done in the pathology lab. This lack of on-site services means that tissue samples are sent to testing laboratories before being assessed for adequacy. As a result, 20-25% of biopsy cases will be deemed inadequate for diagnostic testing and an additional sample will be required (Journal of Otolaryngology, Le et al, 2015). In these situations, a patient must be readmitted for a repeated biopsy, costing the hospital $3,100 that is unable to be reimbursed. With 3.3M biopsies taken annually in the US, more than $2B lost every year. This costly issue is avoidable if the physician is able to have the biopsy’s quality assessed during the procedure, before the patient is discharged.

### Solution
Before the patient’s discharge, a sample’s quality can be determined using the Bioptic™ unit. Biopsy tissue is placed directly onto a glass slide and inserted into the Bioptic™ unit which generates a whole slide image of the sample. The unit uses this image to assess biopsy quality in less than two minutes. This quality review protocol will verify that a viable biopsy was collected with 96% certainty, matching the accuracy of a pathologist’s manual interpretation at a much lower personnel cost (Collins et al., 2013). Our software identifies physical characteristics and the quantity of the target tissue collected to verify that the biopsy procedure successfully extracted enough sample to yield a diagnosis. If a sample is unsuitable for diagnosis, the clinician can simply take a second sample during the same procedure, saving an average hospital $1.8M annually. Additionally, this biopsy assessment protocol would enable hospitals to generate $900k in additional revenue by charging insurance providers through established billing codes that are currently not ordered by the majority of physicians.

### Product
The Bioptic™ unit is a standalone tool placed at the point-of-care. The unit is composed of plastic components that will house a specialized digital microscope, mobile slide stage, and image processing components with an interactive touch display. The unit is optimized for cytology sample analysis, a capability not yet achieved by competing whole slide imagers which are limited to histology imaging. The initial cost to produce the Bioptic™ unit is $8,600 which will decrease to less than $5,555 at scale. Our proprietary algorithms identify the quality and quantity of the target tissue collected to verify that the biopsy procedure successfully extracted enough sample to yield a diagnosis.

We have developed a functional alpha prototype that is able to reconstruct images with submicron resolution. These images are then stitched together with to generate a whole slide image. The resulting image is then run through a three-stage, computer vision analytics process to classify cell clusters with greater than 99.2% accuracy based on internal validation testing on biological slides. The identification of clusters with such accuracy is a critical milestone, as sample adequacy is determined by the number and size of cell clusters present within a sample. We have also built out a functional accompanying cloud infrastructure and have successfully pushed whole slide images to our proprietary and secure cloud. This infrastructure will become a data collection hub storing slide images and deidentified patient data to be used in the continuous improvement of the Bioptic™ machine learning (ML) algorithms critical to the adequacy assessment function. A constantly growing dataset of images used to improve our algorithms will boost Bioptic™ superiority over competition. Finally, we are currently engaged with Pensar, a nationally recognized product development firm, to build out Field Test Units (FTUs) that will be used in our clinical validation studies in Q1 2020. The feedback on the FTUs will allow us to iterate on the design and graphical user interface for launch in 2021.

### Intellectual Property
A provisional patent protecting our automated slide smearing technology was filed through a collaboration with Aurora Consulting and Wolf Greenfield & Sacks, P.C. Our third-party patentability search demonstrated a clear patent landscape for our claims. We have obtained exclusive licensing options to patents from UCONN and UCLA to bolster protection of our ptychographic imaging and digital staining technologies. Omnibus Provisional Patents were submitted in June 2018 and December 2018, which include – Components, Methods, and Techniques for sample preparation, Image Acquisition and Software that comprise our Bioptic™ unit. Additionally, we have a signed letter from the University of Michigan stating that it does not have any ownership claims to the IP that we have developed. We have filed for trademarks protecting both “Pathware” and “Bioptic.”

### Manufacturing
The first 10 units will be assembled in-house in a manner compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices. This will allow us to have flexibility with the design of the first units so that we can rapidly adapt to feedback from FTU users. Based on this feedback, we will iterate on our unit design to optimize functionality and usability. In Q3 2020, we will finalize the design of the internal and external components and hand the manufacturing and assembly process off to a contract manufacturer. We are currently in discussions with four firms that are willing and able to fill this need.

### Regulatory
All matters of the Bioptic™ reader must adhere to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations enforced by the FDA in 21 CFR Subpart H. Pathware has filed a 513(g) application to obtain an FDA confirmation regarding the classification of the Bioptic™ Unit as a Class I device via the De Novo Pathway in May of 2019. We have completed much of the documentation for a Class I device submission and are currently preparing for a Pre-Submission meeting in Q4 2019. Full Regulatory clearance is anticipated in Q2 2021. Our financial model estimates cost for ongoing business operations as well as the additional resources needed to navigate the FDA process. Furthermore, Pathware will apply for ISO certifications and CE mark to market the product in the US and Internationally.

**Revenue Model:** We will sell the Bioptic™ unit to hospitals for $20,000 per unit with a recurring charge of $45 per sample assessed. This $45 price point is less than the $100 value of established reimbursement codes for physician-conducted sample assessment, meaning that the hospital will generate up to $55 in profit every time that they use the BiopticTM system to make an assessment. Current clinical practice shows that multiple samples will need to be assessed in order to achieve a viable biopsy (Hen Lee et al. 2015); resulting in an average revenue of $200 per biopsy procedure. Our initial focus is on Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy assessments in which a thin hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells. Such FNA procedures account for 1/4th of the total biopsies a hospital performs. The 2,000 FNA biopsies that an average hospital performs in a year would generate recurring revenue per hospital of $400,000 per year. Through software upgrades, customers will be able to use the Bioptic™ unit for biopsy procedures other than FNA which will generate additional streams of revenue without hardware updates.

**Go-To-Market Strategy:** 3.3M fine needle aspiration biopsies (US, 2019) are evaluated annually by 5,500 US hospitals. Pathware expects an average revenue of $200 per procedure and $20k per Bioptic™ unit, representing a $1.4B market opportunity.

In 2020, we will conduct beta trials with Michigan Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Washington, UnityPoint Health, Henry Ford Health Systems, and Mount Sinai Hospital. For our initial accounts in our soft launch, we are providing hospitals with a Bioptic™ unit free of charge along with a free trial of 1,000 sample assessments to clearly demonstrate ROI for the institution. The $100,000 in profits generated for the client during the trial will lower the threshold for adoption and shrink the sales cycle to less than four months. Individual Pathology Department Directors have the ability to make the purchasing decision as an operational expense rather than having to go through the lengthy capital expense process that regularly takes 8-12 months to secure a contract. As we expand and achieve market acceptance, we anticipate this sales cycle to approach two months.

Once beta trials are complete, Rodger Moore, current VP of Sales at Philips Healthcare, will come on full time as our Chief Commercial Officer to pursue accounts at 15 key health institutions with whom we are already in discussions for pilots. Specifically, we are targeting the Directors of the Departments of Pathology in larger academic Cancer Centers to lead internal integration of these initial accounts as they are thought leading institutions who have expressed interest in having pathology assessments performed onsite. In 2021, we will hire four sales associates to our outside sales division to establish accounts with at least 15 Cancer Centers. We will then overlay 10 inside sales representatives to reach the 1,500 CoC Accredited Cancer Centers and 4,000 community hospitals and private practices. These accounts have far fewer decision makers resulting in a significantly shorter sales cycle of two months compared to the 6-8 months seen at larger academic facilities. Through a combination of academic publications, conference exhibitions, introductions from early adopters, and targeted outreach, our sales representatives will connect with the directors of Pathology and Radiology to organize a demonstration of the product. As we scale, these demonstrations will largely be conducted virtually as this is quickly becoming the gold standard with medical inside sales teams today. Virtual communications give hospitals the flexibility to organize the demonstration on their own time while also decreasing cost for the sales organization. We will utilize the common “book-and-bill” model where we provide the unit to the institution for trial purposes with an agreement to begin billing after the second month of usage. Many comparable platforms in radiology operate on this sales principal allowing us to capitalize on an existing streamlined purchasing protocol. Following product adoption, sales reps will manage an ongoing account maintenance program with the goal of ensuring positive net promoter scores. Account maintenance will include 24/7 customer support with call center triage, warranty services to repair and replace damaged units, and updates when new unit functionalities are released.

Outside of the hospital marketspace, we are also pursuing partnerships with private diagnostic laboratories. By 2022, we aim to have established a sales account with Quest Diagnostics, a global leader in diagnostic testing and healthcare information technology, to standardize biopsy collection in smaller institutions and outpatient clinics. We are already engaged in communications with Quest Diagnostics, as they are interested in distributing our technology to serve as their entry point into digital pathology. Quest has strong incentive to adopt digital pathology tech; their largest competitor, Lab Corps, has already formed a partnership with Philips. Additionally, we have meet with the senior executive teams from Philips, NVIDIA, Optum Health, Canon, and Tempus to begin additional collaborative discussions in complementary markets.

Once established in the US markets, we will branch into international markets by integrating into neighboring North American Markets ($509M) and then expanding into European ($3.5B) and Asian ($9.1B) markets where our team has medical device sales, distribution, and regulatory experience. With international expansion, our global market opportunity totals $18.3B, based on the current FNAB volumes (5% CAGR).

**Future Development:** To reach our full market opportunity, we plan to further develop in our secondary software packages to expand the utility of our device into additional markets starting in 2023. 20% of the previous year’s revenue will be allocated for the development of additional software packages to expand the utility of the platform beyond biopsy quality control by integrating diagnostic software to determine if tissue samples are benign or malignant. We will initially target tissues that are biopsied by a Fine Needle Aspiration (ex: thyroid, breast, lung) and expand into larger tissue biopsies and other modalities of sample collection such as tissue swabs, touch prep, and blood draws. Our highest priority secondary market is machine learning-based integrated with pap smear imaging. This market is currently valued at $7B and is rapidly expanding at a CAGR of 6.7%. While our full pursuit of developing this technology into our unit is slated for Q1 2023, we have recently taken the early initiative to apply for non-dilutive funding from the NIH SBIR that will support this effort. Additional secondary applications of this platform include but are not limited to infertility testing, veterinary biopsies, telepathology, surgical frozen sections, and urine blood analysis. It is important to note that we can enter each of these markets without having to alter the hardware in any way allowing for rapid expansion and added value for already established accounts.

**Competition:** Our competition can be broken down into four distinct categories: No Quality Assessment, Manual Quality Assessment, Telepathology, and Whole Slide Scanning. No Quality Assessment makes up the majority of our market space as most biopsies take place in out-patient settings where a trained cytopathologist is not available to assess the quality of the sample before the patient leaves. In these cases, the clinician will take multiple samples (up to 5) and send them on for diagnostic work up where 20% will result in an inadequate biopsy determination. While this is fast and cheap in the short term, it results in additive clinical and operational costs down the road. Companies such as Milestone have created mobile lab carts to allow the pathologist to come to the procedure and assess the tissue’s quality at the time of its collection. These carts are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process significantly increases procedure time. Larger hospitals use telepathology tools such as Mikroscan to keep their pathologist in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for remote assessment. While this saves pathologist transit times, remote assessments do not address the challenges of manual assessments, as they require even more time and people to implement. Furthermore, remote assessments are not reimbursable under current coding schema. Whole Slide Scanning platforms such as Philips Intellisite are indirect competition as these technologies are laboratory based and have no quality assessment component meaning that they do not apply to this current market need. We will rely on the aforementioned patents protecting sample preparation, image acquisition, and software as a barrier to entry against potential, future, direct competition. In the long term, our expansive cloud-based dataset of images, diagnoses, and patient information used to train our machine learning models will offer substantial product superiority and will act as an additional preemptive response to direct and indirect competition.

### Strategic Partners

Philips Healthcare is currently the leader in the digital pathology sector with recent acquisitions, partnerships, and a landmark FDA clearance for its whole slide imaging (WSI) platform, Intellisite. We are positioning ourselves for partnership with Philips in the next 3-5 years as we complement their current WSI efforts due to technical limitations in their Intellisite system which do not allow for the analysis of cytology samples. We have met with the global directors of Philip’s Digital Pathology division, and are in regular communication as we continue to develop our product and establish market traction.

Private Clinical Labs, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, work as independent pathology laboratories for more than 3,000 hospitals. They confirmed that the failure rate of their biopsies is a concern for their business, and they fear losing their clients to competitors.
