Before the patient’s discharge, a sample’s quality can be determined using the Bioptic™ unit. Biopsy tissue is placed directly onto a glass slide and inserted into the Bioptic™ unit which generates a whole slide image of the sample. The unit uses this image to assess biopsy quality in less than two minutes. This quality review protocol will verify that a viable biopsy was collected with 96% certainty, matching the accuracy of a pathologist’s manual interpretation at a much lower personnel cost (Collins et al., 2013). Our software identifies physical characteristics and the quantity of the target tissue collected to verify that the biopsy procedure successfully extracted enough sample to yield a diagnosis. If a sample is unsuitable for diagnosis, the clinician can simply take a second sample during the same procedure, saving an average hospital $1.8M annually. Additionally, this biopsy assessment protocol would enable hospitals to generate $900k in additional revenue by charging insurance providers through established billing codes that are currently not ordered by the majority of physicians.
