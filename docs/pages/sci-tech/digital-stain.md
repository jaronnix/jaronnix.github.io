Pathware employs a state-of-the-art deep neural network developed and validated at UCLA to produce false-colorized pathology images without the need for physical staining.[^1] This digital staining technique, named PhaseStain, transforms quantitative phase images (QPI) of label-free tissue sections (produced by FPM) into equivalent brightfield microscopy images of the same sample.[^2] Through pairs of image data (QPI and the corresponding brightfield images, acquired after staining), the trained network demonstrated high accuracy across various tissues, matching the brightfield microscopy images of the same samples stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Jones’ stain, and Masson’s trichrome stain as seen below.

This digital-staining framework may further strengthen various uses of label-free QPI techniques in pathology applications and biomedical research in general, by eliminating the need for histological staining, reducing sample preparation related costs and saving time.
