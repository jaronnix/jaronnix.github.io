Two main methods of ROSE currently exist: manual quality assessment and telepathology. Manual quality assessment has been attempted by companies such as Milestone, who has created mobile lab carts to allow the pathologist to come to the procedure and assess the tissue\u2019s quality at the time of its collection. Larger hospitals use telepathology tools such as Mikroscan to keep their pathologists in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for remote assessment. American Society of Cytopathology The advantages of ROSE service are primarily driven by goals of improved personalized care and better outcomes for patients. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, the American Society of Cytopathology supports the availability and use of a rapid on\u2010site evaluation (ROSE) service provided by pathologists and experienced cytotechnologists for FNA and selected core biopsy. ROSE of FNA biopsies significantly reduces the need for repeat procedures, making it an effective solution to this issue. 1 However, current ROSE technologies are not cost-effective, timely, or user-friendly. The carts manufactured by Milestone are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process increases procedure time by approximately 50 minutes. Additionally, the cost of setting up a mobile pathology lab station can range from $75k-$200k. 2 Products similar to those manufactured by Mikroscan may save pathologist transit times but they do not address the challenges of manual assessments, as they require even more time and people to implement. 3 Regardless of technological merits, ROSE solutions that involve physician labor face the hurdle that is a growing pathologist shortage in the United States. 4 A country already strained by diagnostic demand cannot be expected to also produce the second set of resources needed to evaluate biopsy adequacy.

FNAB is widely regarded as the preferred biopsy method for thyroid nodules 1 and is becoming an increasingly valued method for bronchial, pancreatic, lymphatic, and oral tissue as well. 2 In the United States in 2016, 2,837,898 FNA biopsies were taken accounting for 15% of all biopsies. 3 By the year 2040, we expect this number to climb to over 6.7 million. Advancements in imaging techniques such as ultrasound guidance have coincided with this substantial rise in FNAB adoption by improving both safety and procedural accuracy. 4 Unfortunately, FNABs frequently fail to provide a satisfactory tissue sample for an off-site pathologist to render a diagnosis. Hospital Revenue Loss A review of the literature suggests that as many as 27% of original FNABs are deemed inadequate and the evaluating pathologist is unable to provide a diagnosis. 5 An FNAB may be deemed inadequate for a variety of reasons, including limited cellularity, no follicular cells, or poor fixation and preservation. 6 A failure to diagnose means that 1 in 5 patients will have to return for a repeat procedure, a non-refundable hospital expense. The failure rate for repeat procedures has been shown to even higher, as much as 62%`. 7 Under the current reimbursement schema, a first-time FNA biopsy can be reimbursed at a rate of $415.46. 8 If necessary, a second, non-reimbursable FNAB costs a hospital $3000/procedure which translates to an average of $1.2M in losses per hospital annually. 9 Nationwide, $1.2/hospital means that a total of $1.9B is lost each year to failed FNA biopsies.

Analytical Pathology Clincal guidance during diagnostic workflows. Post-analytical Pathology Diagnostic interpretations rendered into decision support (e.g, predicting necessary laboratory tests). As detailed in Pathologist Shortage , pathologist numbers are declining while physician burnout and workloads are increasing. Overworked pathologists are prone to errors in all categories of work, especially tasks within the pre-analytical phase. A meta-analysis revealed that pre-analytical error rates range between 31.8% and 68.2%. 5 Our Bioptic unit is designed to be placed at the point of care during the pre-analytical portion of pathology workflows. We aim to reduce the growing burdens placed on a dwindling pathologist population in order to reduce these costly errors, all while generating additional revenue for hospitals. Makary MA, Daniel M.

The number of pathologists globally continues to decline, placing a greater burden on an already strained field. Due to the limited bandwidth of pathologists, onsite services to verify the quality of the samples being collected are typically bypassed in favor of higher priority and more lucrative work done in the pathology lab. This lack of on-site services means that tissue samples are sent to testing laboratories before being assessed for adequacy. As a result, 20-25% of biopsy cases will be deemed inadequate for diagnostic testing and an additional sample will be required. 1 In these situations, a patient must be readmitted for a repeated biopsy, costing the hospital $3,100 that is unable to be reimbursed. With 3.3M biopsies taken annually in the US, more than $2B lost every year. This costly issue is avoidable if the physician is able to have the biopsy\u2019s quality assessed during the procedure, before the patient is discharged. A Shrinking Workforce Pathologists are becoming increasingly scarce assets in nations around the globe while the burden of cancer still weighs heavy. Pathware seeks to address this growing global shortage of pathologists through the development of software and hardware solutions to simplify digital pathology workflows. The United States experienced a 17% decline in the pathologist workforce from 2007 to 2017 equating to a 42% increase in individual workloads. 1 Recent surveys are beginning to illustrate the severity of burnout that such workloads cause, with 36% of pathologists reporting \"long-term, unresolvable job-related stress that leads to exhaustion, cynicism, and feelings of detachment.\" On a global scale, >50% of the world's pathologists are located within the United States which contains only 4% of the global population. 2 Low-income countries such as Zimbabwe or Mozambique report single-digit numbers of pathologists despite populations exceeding 13 million and 24 million, respectively. 3 Meanwhile, cancer remains the second leading cause of death worldwide.

In fact, the number of pathologists leaving the workforce is actually outpacing new additions. 5 This trend is predicted to continue until at least 2030 and likely beyond. Point-of-Care Failures The fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure used to collect a small amount of tissue for cytopathological evaluation. FNAB is widely regarded as the preferred biopsy method for thyroid nodules 6 and is becoming an increasingly valued method for bronchial, pancreatic, lymphatic, and oral tissue as well. 7 In the United States in 2016, 2,837,898 FNA biopsies were taken accounting for 15% of all biopsies. 8 By the year 2040, we expect this number to climb to over 6.7 million. Advancements in imaging techniques such as ultrasound guidance have coincided with this substantial rise in FNAB adoption by improving both safety and procedural accuracy. 9 Unfortunately, FNABs frequently fail to provide a satisfactory tissue sample for an off-site pathologist to render a diagnosis. Hospital Revenue Loss A review of the literature suggests that as many as 27% of original FNABs are deemed inadequate and the evaluating pathologist is unable to provide a diagnosis. 10 An FNAB may be deemed inadequate for a variety of reasons, including limited cellularity, no follicular cells, or poor fixation and preservation. 11 A failure to diagnose means that 1 in 5 patients will have to return for a repeat procedure, a non-refundable hospital expense. The failure rate for repeat procedures has been shown to even higher, as much as 62%`. 12 Under the current reimbursement schema, a first-time FNA biopsy can be reimbursed at a rate of $415.46. 13 If necessary, a second, non-reimbursable FNAB costs a hospital $3000/procedure which translates to an average of $1.2M in losses per hospital annually. 14 Nationwide, $1.2/hospital means that a total of $1.9B is lost each year to failed FNA biopsies. Rapid On-site Evaluation In an effort to reduce the need for repeat procedures, physicians have turned to rapid, on-site evaluation (ROSE). Two main methods of ROSE currently exist: manual quality assessment and telepathology. Manual quality assessment has been attempted by companies such as Milestone, who has created mobile lab carts to allow the pathologist to come to the procedure and assess the tissue\u2019s quality at the time of its collection. Larger hospitals use telepathology tools such as Mikroscan to keep their pathologists in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for remote assessment. American Society of Cytopathology The advantages of ROSE service are primarily driven by goals of improved personalized care and better outcomes for patients. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, the American Society of Cytopathology supports the availability and use of a rapid on\u2010site evaluation (ROSE) service provided by pathologists and experienced cytotechnologists for FNA and selected core biopsy. ROSE of FNA biopsies significantly reduces the need for repeat procedures, making it an effective solution to this issue. 15 However, current ROSE technologies are not cost-effective, timely, or user-friendly. The carts manufactured by Milestone are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process increases procedure time by approximately 50 minutes. Additionally, the cost of setting up a mobile pathology lab station can range from $75k-$200k. 16 Products similar to those manufactured by Mikroscan may save pathologist transit times but they do not address the challenges of manual assessments, as they require even more time and people to implement. 17 Regardless of technological merits, ROSE solutions that involve physician labor face the hurdle that is a growing pathologist shortage in the United States. 18 A country already strained by diagnostic demand cannot be expected to also produce the second set of resources needed to evaluate biopsy adequacy.

The Bioptic unit will be sold to hospitals for $20,000 with a recurring charge of $45 per sample assessed. This $45/sample price is substantially lower than the potential revenues of established reimbursement codes; the operator is thereby able to generate up to $100 in revenue each time Bioptic renders an assessment. Pathware recognizes that multiple assessments will likely be needed to achieve a quality sample. 1 Typically, four (4) needle 'passes' are required to sufficiently sample a lesion and company revenue is expected to average $200 per biopsy procedure. Our initial focus is on fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) assessments. Such FNAB procedures account for 1/4 of the total biopsies a hospital performs. The 2,000 FNABs that an average hospital performs annually would generate recurring revenue per hospital of $400,000 per year. Through future software upgrades, our goal is to allow customers to use the Bioptic unit for biopsy procedures other than FNA, which will generate additional streams of revenue without any hardware updates needed. This specific business model structure that Pathware is pursuing has been dubbed Enterprise Monitoring as a Service (EMaaS). EMaaS has been growing in popularity as of late with healthcare giants Philips and Jackson Health System forging a long-term, strategic partnership around the model. Cost of Goods Sold [INSERT COST OF GOODS SOLD DATA HERE] Reimbursement Model The Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) procedure is broken into three billable processes: 10021/10022: Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy with or without image guidance 88172/88177: Rapid Onsite Evaluation for Adequacy 88173: Final diagnosis of FNA sample The biopsy (10021) and the diagnosis (88173) are billed regardless of the presence or absence of an on-site evaluation for the adequacy or what techniques were used to come to the final diagnosis (e.g. flow cytometry, cell block, etc.). However, both codes are limited in that they can only be billed for a single occurrence per nodule per month. The Rapid Onsite Evaluation for Adequacy (88172) has a total reimbursement potential from CMS of $69.21 (TC: $25.94, PC:$43.27) for the first evaluation event and $36.00 (TC: $9.55, PC: $26.45) for each additional sample collected until an adequate biopsy is collected. These codes do not have any time restrictions that would limit their ability to be billed. It is important to note that this code can only be billed if an onsite evaluation of the tissue collected from an FNA is performed. Being that most of the market (93-95%) has not implemented any technique to perform this procedure, using the Bioptic would open a new line of billing for many of the users that they were previously leaving on the table. This billable income increase coupled with the cost savings of repeated procedures reduction means a positive impact on both the top and bottom line for their client institutions.

Our models have Pathware achieving a 5th-year revenue of $75MM with profits at $32.6MM, approaching a valuation over 10X total financing raised ($38MM) at approximately $400MM-$450MM. Pre-Series B (24 Months) Pathware\u2019s first opportunity for acquisition takes place just prior to the closing of a Series B round. At this stage, Pathware fits a category of acquisitions known as a bolt-on acquisition : this data has been gathered from a series of discussions with the international business development team for Philips Healthcare\u2019s Digital Pathology division. Specifically, Philips mentioned that they look to acquire at 10-15 active hospital clients for $50MM-$75MM, at 8x-10x of Pathware\u2019s revenue in 24 months. Post-Series B (48 Months) Pathware\u2019s second opportunity for exit occurs after significant traction our beachhead market: biopsy quality assessment. Evidence of traction is shown after they secure cash-flow-positive status, begin expanding globally, and start exploring secondary applications that venture into the diagnostic realm (known as biopsy triage). This the standard maturity at which Life Science companies tend to exit; as they start to compete with incumbents such as Philips, Roche, and Hologic, they prefer to purchase the technology and customer base rather than re-engineer and recapture their own. Evidenced by a number of comparable companies, described below, Pathware can reasonably expect a valuation of 6X to 8X revenue: $350MM-$450MM. An acquisition at this stage would result in more than 10X returned on all investment taken throughout the life of the company.

No Quality Assessment makes up the majority of our market space as most biopsies take place in out-patient settings where a trained cytopathologist is not available to assess the quality of the sample before the patient leaves. In these cases, the clinician will take multiple samples (up to 5) and send them on for diagnostic work up where 20% will result in an inadequate biopsy determination. While this is fast and cheap in the short term, it results in additive clinical and operational costs down the road. Companies such as Milestone have created mobile lab carts to allow the pathologist to come to the procedure and assess the tissue\u2019s quality at the time of its collection. These carts are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process significantly increases procedure time. Larger hospitals use telepathology tools such as Mikroscan to keep their pathologist in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for remote assessment. While this saves pathologist transit times, remote assessments do not address the challenges of manual assessments, as they require even more time and people to implement. Furthermore, remote assessments are not reimbursable under current coding schema. Whole Slide Scanning platforms such as Philips Intellisite are indirect competition as these technologies are laboratory based and have no quality assessment component meaning that they do not apply to this current market need. We will rely on the aforementioned patents protecting sample preparation, image acquisition, and software as a barrier to entry against potential, future, direct competition. In the long term, our expansive cloud-based dataset of images, diagnoses, and patient information used to train our machine learning models will offer substantial product superiority and will act as an additional preemptive response to direct and indirect competition.

Pathware expects an average revenue of $200 per procedure and $20k per Bioptic\u2122 unit, representing a $1.4B market opportunity. In 2020, we will conduct beta trials with Michigan Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Washington, UnityPoint Health, Henry Ford Health Systems, and Mount Sinai Hospital. For our initial accounts in our soft launch, we are providing hospitals with a Bioptic\u2122 unit free of charge along with a free trial of 1,000 sample assessments to clearly demonstrate ROI for the institution. The $100,000 in profits generated for the client during the trial will lower the threshold for adoption and shrink the sales cycle to less than four months. Individual Pathology Department Directors have the ability to make the purchasing decision as an operational expense rather than having to go through the lengthy capital expense process that regularly takes 8-12 months to secure a contract. As we expand and achieve market acceptance, we anticipate this sales cycle to approach two months. Once beta trials are complete, Rodger Moore, current VP of Sales at Philips Healthcare, will come on full time as our Chief Commercial Officer to pursue accounts at 15 key health institutions with whom we are already in discussions for pilots. Specifically, we are targeting the Directors of the Departments of Pathology in larger academic Cancer Centers to lead internal integration of these initial accounts as they are thought leading institutions who have expressed interest in having pathology assessments performed onsite. In 2021, we will hire four sales associates to our outside sales division to establish accounts with at least 15 Cancer Centers. We will then overlay 10 inside sales representatives to reach the 1,500 CoC Accredited Cancer Centers and 4,000 community hospitals and private practices. These accounts have far fewer decision makers resulting in a significantly shorter sales cycle of two months compared to the 6-8 months seen at larger academic facilities. Through a combination of academic publications, conference exhibitions, introductions from early adopters, and targeted outreach, our sales representatives will connect with the directors of Pathology and Radiology to organize a demonstration of the product. As we scale, these demonstrations will largely be conducted virtually as this is quickly becoming the gold standard with medical inside sales teams today. Virtual communications give hospitals the flexibility to organize the demonstration on their own time while also decreasing cost for the sales organization. We will utilize the common \u201cbook-and-bill\u201d model where we provide the unit to the institution for trial purposes with an agreement to begin billing after the second month of usage. Many comparable platforms in radiology operate on this sales principal allowing us to capitalize on an existing streamlined purchasing protocol. Following product adoption, sales reps will manage an ongoing account maintenance program with the goal of ensuring positive net promoter scores. Account maintenance will include 24/7 customer support with call center triage, warranty services to repair and replace damaged units, and updates when new unit functionalities are released. Outside of the hospital marketspace, we are also pursuing partnerships with private diagnostic laboratories. By 2022, we aim to have established a sales account with Quest Diagnostics, a global leader in diagnostic testing and healthcare information technology, to standardize biopsy collection in smaller institutions and outpatient clinics. We are already engaged in communications with Quest Diagnostics, as they are interested in distributing our technology to serve as their entry point into digital pathology. Quest has strong incentive to adopt digital pathology tech; their largest competitor, Lab Corps, has already formed a partnership with Philips. Additionally, we have meet with the senior executive teams from Philips, NVIDIA, Optum Health, Canon, and Tempus to begin additional collaborative discussions in complementary markets. Once established in the US markets, we will branch into international markets by integrating into neighboring North American Markets ($509M) and then expanding into European ($3.5B) and Asian ($9.1B) markets where our team has medical device sales, distribution, and regulatory experience. With international expansion, our global market opportunity totals $18.3B, based on the current FNAB volumes (5% CAGR).

The number of pathologists globally continues to decline, placing a greater burden on an already strained field. Due to the limited bandwidth of pathologists, onsite services to verify the quality of the samples being collected are typically bypassed in favor of higher priority and more lucrative work done in the pathology lab. This lack of on-site services means that tissue samples are sent to testing laboratories before being assessed for adequacy. As a result, 20-25% of biopsy cases will be deemed inadequate for diagnostic testing and an additional sample will be required (Journal of Otolaryngology, Le et al, 2015). In these situations, a patient must be readmitted for a repeated biopsy, costing the hospital $3,100 that is unable to be reimbursed. With 3.3M biopsies taken annually in the US, more than $2B lost every year.

The initial cost to produce the Bioptic\u2122 unit is $8,600 which will decrease to less than $5,555 at scale. Our proprietary algorithms identify the quality and quantity of the target tissue collected to verify that the biopsy procedure successfully extracted enough sample to yield a diagnosis. We have developed a functional alpha prototype that is able to reconstruct images with submicron resolution. These images are then stitched together with to generate a whole slide image. The resulting image is then run through a three-stage, computer vision analytics process to classify cell clusters with greater than 99.2% accuracy based on internal validation testing on biological slides. The identification of clusters with such accuracy is a critical milestone, as sample adequacy is determined by the number and size of cell clusters present within a sample. We have also built out a functional accompanying cloud infrastructure and have successfully pushed whole slide images to our proprietary and secure cloud. This infrastructure will become a data collection hub storing slide images and deidentified patient data to be used in the continuous improvement of the Bioptic\u2122 machine learning (ML) algorithms critical to the adequacy assessment function.

Current clinical practice shows that multiple samples will need to be assessed in order to achieve a viable biopsy (Hen Lee et al. 2015); resulting in an average revenue of $200 per biopsy procedure. Our initial focus is on Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy assessments in which a thin hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells. Such FNA procedures account for 1/4th of the total biopsies a hospital performs.

Pathware will go about identifying these clusters by combining a series of established Computer Vision techniques to localize cells across the whole slide image. Stage 1 : Identify nucleated cells with Fast Radial Symmetry (FRS). FRS is a well established technique in computer vision processing and has been shown to identify upwards of 99.8% of all nucleated cells in histology slides. In Pathware\u2019s limited tests on blood smears, they have been able to identify 100% of nucleated cells present on the slide. https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OH4QJaYoCp7tVWdRrR6ZA9nB-_mRurr-4NFhVbr26a6gV2me0kCoZ1OSR4lwIFl7-_Qo8iqJ2OxuL7ffwDeZOA8l93_0iPjVU7ewUCn596_CKNtWETi0MJl4_qBsQk3r-o1k9Uk4 Stage 2 : Identify cell clusters with k-means ++.

Although FRS delivers good performance at a relatively low computational cost and is very well suited for a variety of real-time computer vision applications, it is not invariant to perspective distortions. The inclusion of an affine transformation improves the overall accuracy of cell identification. FRS utilizes local radial symmetry to highlight points of interest within a scene. Its low-computational complexity and fast runtimes make this method well-suited for real-time vision applications. The performance of the transform is demonstrated on a wide variety of images and compared with leading techniques from the literature. Both as a facial feature detector and as a generic region of interest detector the new transform is seen to offer equal or superior performance to contemporary techniques at a relatively low computational cost. Previous methods: require the gradient to be quantized into angular bins, the contribution of every orientation is computed in a single pass over the image. Pathware\u2019s new method works well with a general fixed parameter set, however, it can also be tuned to exclusively detect particular kinds of features The approach presented herein determines the contribution each pixel makes to the symmetry of pixels around it, rather than considering the contribution of a local neighborhood to a central pixel. K-Means ++ Clustering ( https://bit.ly/2st6KeH ) K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labeled outcomes. The means in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid within a set of clustered. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities. Usually referred to simply as \u201ck-means,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s algorithm begins with k arbitrary \u201ccenters,\u201d typically chosen uniformly at random from the data points. Each point is then assigned to the nearest center, and each center is recomputed as the center of mass of all points assigned to it. These last two steps are repeated until the process stabilizes. One can check that \u03c6 is monotonically decreasing, which ensures that no configuration is repeated during the course of the algorithm. Since there are only kn possible clusterings, the process will always terminate. K-Means ++ differs from traditional K-Means methods by utilizing a more intuitive selection of initial centroids, leading to improved cluster definition that is O(log k)-competitive with the optimal clustering, as well as considerable increases in speed and accuracy. This improved algorithm achieves greater initialization by using first choosing an initial center c1 uniformly at random from data subset, X. Then, the vector containing the square distances between all points in the dataset is computed. Second, a second center c2 is chosen from an additional subsection of data, X, randomly drawn from the probability distribution. Third, the distance vector is recomputed. Fourth, a successive center c1 is chosen and the distance vector is recomputed. Finally, when exactly k centers have been chosen, the initialization phase is finalized and proceeds with the standard k-means algorithm. If the minimum required value of K \u2265 6 is not met with a total of 10 points within a radial distance of D from the centroid, then the sample will be deemed inadequate. Below you will find three examples of their functional K-Means algorithm operating on 1,000 data points. The black dots represent randomly generated points comprising 8-10 clusters with each red dot representing an incorrect approximation and each green dot representing the central point of the cluster after 1-2 iterative approximations. This process was completed in less than 0.5 seconds and is easily scalable to meet the needs of assessing a whole slide image. https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gChmJRHTsx9e9HZNgMQgNk_6I2vo0sx1tBwkO8gKdd42K1Gq0HGdkv-VxKT3Fsg4t-OMsz1e_dg5xaMq3n5FqFU-Ah1NN3O90ti_6x4WhdZpoCuX1YJdLRK1hFt52bO-N6bkZFhI https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QVPuPiP_eEv6FpWo0Pt0wbV3QU4iEM-xzBF6uz1NgIEPybyyLAPiGQEqk2rudaKdSRam_Pc5Kk6uUlQmzpQsvJknsedCbep9wG_hvIXAwoyJmoJ79-W7vzkO9g8Ptq8hKk6D9Bqa https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tjOn43x8KrVeMsPpPc3ej3uYBZMgZLLBRCw5F45A00vuEl2Ty2e-KdMlg-ctLegMX92gQqsEsbHn1u-H4uFc7ov8BBUmH5mFfNiNw012R3Ve90mRZCbHRgR3FFuXbKw7iW0oLk2s Parameters governing K-Means ++ clustering The number of Data Points (N): Convert the matrix of data points, representing the location of nuclei, into a total number of points. These points are divided into subsections based on the number of clusters pre-defined by the Pham method for calculation of K and iteratively determined subsections using a probability distribution algorithm. Number of Clusters (K): The Pham method for calculation of K uses the value of f(K), the ratio of the real distortion to the estimated distortion. The smaller that f(K) is, the more concentrated is the data distribution. Thus, values of K that yield small f(K) can be regarded as giving well-defined clusters. In addition, f(K) values close to 1 represent a uniform distribution of the data. Convergence: The centroid location is optimized by reducing the in-cluster sum of squares. Convergence is reached when the centroids have stabilized\u200a\u2014\u200athere is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful, or the defined number of iterations has been achieved. Computer Vision (Future) Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Ratio The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (also variously known as the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio, nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, N:C ratio, or N/C) is a measurement used in cell biology. It is a ratio of the size (i.e., volume) of the nucleus of a cell to the size of the cytoplasm of that cell. The N:C ratio indicates the maturity of a cell, because as a cell matures the size of its nucleus generally decreases. So, for example, \"blast\" forms of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and megakaryocytes start with an N:C ratio of 4:1 , which decreases as they mature to 2:1 or even 1:1 (with exceptions for mature thrombocytes and erythrocytes, which are anuclear cells, and mature lymphocytes, which only decrease to a 3:1 ratio and often retain the original 4:1 ratio). An increased N:C ratio is commonly associated with precancerous dysplasia as well as with malignant cells. The N:C ratio is a better predictor of malignancy than increased nuclear size. https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cJWg2aD9O6NppE2I83KZyzUi3x2m-InJhgEEUFuoJAu-NP-LtWzEbwx_ObelZLKLT3P-sXawzioePr4mSDb3aushCR0BRIS1PukBmUK39mk6f1uf_YjGcnqgAuZBU96nVGyZ4iba Nuclear-Cytoplasmic ratio visual https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Rrk97HgVK9-YSxGcXawxq2-jvtkNtxCzzM8awdkt1l74xMMnPiQbH1_GLOiCvfBeOJD_ZKrJyubCRQk2ceIbsxerpARU5hdXH2wgm2Q3fhUm4ozfPnoTPNNZbLYe2xc37SEKXNNa Red outlined cells (left) have been analyzed for N/C ratio (right) https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cpoPH7kGsnh_-o6tIfT4ewSb6QiZTIqecSfTNQdFl0bb3YNTYwHuYRK4Vqtiz0AujPqDRX5by_XAzqGrQ23UaxuM3qu3HDfz7tiD8GfAJng05dIEZc3iuTCCQFoJ4HD4mSBKXsRz","title":"Tissue Adequacy Assessment"},{"location":"pages/sci-tech/analytics/#automated-adequacy-assessment","text":"[AARON NEEDS TO EDIT] Adequacy of a Fine Needle Aspiration is generally defined as identifying 6 clumps of 10 nucleated cell clusters.

Pathware\u2019s new method works well with a general fixed parameter set, however, it can also be tuned to exclusively detect particular kinds of features The approach presented herein determines the contribution each pixel makes to the symmetry of pixels around it, rather than considering the contribution of a local neighborhood to a central pixel.","title":"Fast Radial Symmetry Detection With Affine Transform"},{"location":"pages/sci-tech/analytics/#k-means-clustering","text":"( https://bit.ly/2st6KeH ) K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labeled outcomes. The means in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid within a set of clustered. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities. Usually referred to simply as \u201ck-means,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s algorithm begins with k arbitrary \u201ccenters,\u201d typically chosen uniformly at random from the data points. Each point is then assigned to the nearest center, and each center is recomputed as the center of mass of all points assigned to it. These last two steps are repeated until the process stabilizes. One can check that \u03c6 is monotonically decreasing, which ensures that no configuration is repeated during the course of the algorithm. Since there are only kn possible clusterings, the process will always terminate. K-Means ++ differs from traditional K-Means methods by utilizing a more intuitive selection of initial centroids, leading to improved cluster definition that is O(log k)-competitive with the optimal clustering, as well as considerable increases in speed and accuracy. This improved algorithm achieves greater initialization by using first choosing an initial center c1 uniformly at random from data subset, X. Then, the vector containing the square distances between all points in the dataset is computed. Second, a second center c2 is chosen from an additional subsection of data, X, randomly drawn from the probability distribution. Third, the distance vector is recomputed. Fourth, a successive center c1 is chosen and the distance vector is recomputed. Finally, when exactly k centers have been chosen, the initialization phase is finalized and proceeds with the standard k-means algorithm. If the minimum required value of K \u2265 6 is not met with a total of 10 points within a radial distance of D from the centroid, then the sample will be deemed inadequate. Below you will find three examples of their functional K-Means algorithm operating on 1,000 data points. The black dots represent randomly generated points comprising 8-10 clusters with each red dot representing an incorrect approximation and each green dot representing the central point of the cluster after 1-2 iterative approximations. This process was completed in less than 0.5 seconds and is easily scalable to meet the needs of assessing a whole slide image. https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gChmJRHTsx9e9HZNgMQgNk_6I2vo0sx1tBwkO8gKdd42K1Gq0HGdkv-VxKT3Fsg4t-OMsz1e_dg5xaMq3n5FqFU-Ah1NN3O90ti_6x4WhdZpoCuX1YJdLRK1hFt52bO-N6bkZFhI https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QVPuPiP_eEv6FpWo0Pt0wbV3QU4iEM-xzBF6uz1NgIEPybyyLAPiGQEqk2rudaKdSRam_Pc5Kk6uUlQmzpQsvJknsedCbep9wG_hvIXAwoyJmoJ79-W7vzkO9g8Ptq8hKk6D9Bqa https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tjOn43x8KrVeMsPpPc3ej3uYBZMgZLLBRCw5F45A00vuEl2Ty2e-KdMlg-ctLegMX92gQqsEsbHn1u-H4uFc7ov8BBUmH5mFfNiNw012R3Ve90mRZCbHRgR3FFuXbKw7iW0oLk2s Parameters governing K-Means ++ clustering The number of Data Points (N): Convert the matrix of data points, representing the location of nuclei, into a total number of points. These points are divided into subsections based on the number of clusters pre-defined by the Pham method for calculation of K and iteratively determined subsections using a probability distribution algorithm. Number of Clusters (K): The Pham method for calculation of K uses the value of f(K), the ratio of the real distortion to the estimated distortion. The smaller that f(K) is, the more concentrated is the data distribution. Thus, values of K that yield small f(K) can be regarded as giving well-defined clusters. In addition, f(K) values close to 1 represent a uniform distribution of the data. Convergence: The centroid location is optimized by reducing the in-cluster sum of squares. Convergence is reached when the centroids have stabilized\u200a\u2014\u200athere is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful, or the defined number of iterations has been achieved.","title":"K-Means ++ Clustering"},{"location":"pages/sci-tech/analytics/#computer-vision-future","text":"","title":"Computer Vision (Future)"},{"location":"pages/sci-tech/analytics/#nuclear-cytoplasmic-ratio","text":"The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (also variously known as the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio, nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, N:C ratio, or N/C) is a measurement used in cell biology.

Our phase retrieval technique is able to recover lost phase information via intensity-only measurements. This is accomplished by using alternating enforcements of the known information of the object in the spatial and Fourier domains. [WHAT IS PHASE IMAGERY] The Bioptic\u2122 unit images no differently than standardized video microscopes: a wide-field objective lens, typically 2X or 4X, projects an image on to a standard CMOS sensor, typically \u2154\u201d or 1.0\u201d. The numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens is the limiting factor in gathering detail for most microscopy sensors. Optical systems are limited in resolution by diffraction, also known as spatial bandwidth, offering a hard-stop to the resolution that a standard lens and CMOS sensor can achieve. The finest resolution able to be achieved in a given optical system is listed below, where \u03bb is the wavelength of light (nm): $$\\mathrm{R} \\mathrm{limit} = \\frac{\\mathrm{\u03bb}}{2\\mathrm{NA} \\mathrm{system}}$$ In a standard microscopy system, one with a 4X 0.10NA lens illuminated by full-spectrum light, diffraction causes \u2018airy-disks\u2019 that prevents usable spatial data at a limit of 3.5-2.0\u00b5m/pixel. In a system of higher numerical aperture, one with a 40X 0.65NA lens and an identical sensor, the resolution limit becomes 538-307 nm/pixel. In order to bypass this spatial bandwidth constraint and obtain wide-field data with sub-micron resolution, an optical system must have low objective magnifications and high numerical apertures, a combination that is unachievable with modern lenses and sensors alone. In order to bypass the spatial resolution constraint, Pathware manipulates the following equation: $$\\mathrm{NA} \\mathrm{system} = \\mathrm{NA} \\mathrm{lens} + \\mathrm{NA}_\\mathrm{illumination}$$ Altering the NA illumination enables us to increase the numerical aperture of the system significantly, therefore increasing the final detail able to be resolved in such a system, simply by increasing the cone of light that makes up the final illumination angle. Pathware does this by sequencing a pattern of LEDs, thus far done in a 17x17 grid, and gathering a set of low-resolution microscopy images, each illuminated from a unique angle. They then take each image into Fourier space and super-resolve a final gigapixel image of the sample, creating a wide-field high-spatial bandwidth whole slide image. Whole Slide Imaging Whole slide imaging is an increasingly common technique to store pathology data. Digitization of tissues through imaging is a space-efficient but computationally heavy task, often requiring petabytes for major institutions and scan-times on the order of hours. Histology data, cut into thin sections and neatly preserved and stained, is a relatively simple and highly-utilized implementation of whole slide imaging. Cytology, with its hugely-variable focal plane and microscopic feature size, provides a greater challenge to implementing this sample-digitization process. New optical techniques are needed to digitize cytology: one that has a large depth-of-field, a wide field-of-view, and able to resolve the ultra-fine details that typical scanning lenses cannot. Spectral Illumination In order to generate a set of full-field images, a specimen is illuminated at various angles of incidence via a two-dimensional LED array. Each image is acquired under the illumination of coherent light sources at these various angles of incidence. The different illumination angles correspond to images of different regions of frequency space. The set of acquired images is combined, using an iterative phase retrieval algorithm, into a final high-resolution image (a high space-bandwidth product). Reassembling these regions into a single frequency domain image means that much higher resolution is obtained over the full field of view (FOV) of the microscope. Furthermore, FPM reconstructs the complex image of the object. As a result, amplitude (or intensity) and quantitative phase information can both be gathered using this technique. However, opposed to interferometric imaging techniques such as holography, FPM is much easier to implement. Typically, from an array of LEDs, each image is acquired under the illumination of coherent light source at various angles of incidence. The different illumination angles correspond to imaging different regions of frequency space. The set of acquired images is combined, using an iterative phase retrieval algorithm, into a final high-resolution image (a high space-bandwidth product).

However, opposed to interferometric imaging techniques such as holography, FPM is much easier to implement. [PHOTOS OF THE LED ARRAY] [VIDEO OF LED ARRAY FIRING] Pathware's Image Capture Module uses an array of light sources to illuminate the sample from different incident angles and acquire corresponding low-resolution images using a monochromatic camera. Upon collecting an entire set of images, each with a unique illumination angle, the Fourier ptychographic recovery routine recovers a high-resolution image of the cytology sample. A key feature of Bioptic's capabilities is that the recorded intensity images contain object information that is beyond the cutoff frequency of the collection optics \u2013 meaning that we are able to capture what a conventional brightfield microscope cannot. Our Image Capture Module is able to acquire images under different structured light patterns and is able to use the Fourier ptychographic algorithm to recover the super-resolution WSI and previously unknown illumination patterns. Fourier Ptychography Pytchography is the act of 'reconstructing' an object from a series of measured diffraction patterns. From a multitue Our friends and collaborators at the University of Connecticut have a fantastic introduction to FPM here and their explanation of the subject should be taken as ground truth. What is Ptychography? Ptychography Explained from Will Armson on Vimeo . If an object is illuminated with coherent electromagnetic radiation (e.g., visible light), a diffraction pattern is formed (related\u2013via the eponymous Fourier transform) to the optical transmission function of the object. The aim of ptychography is to directly reconstruct the original optical transmission function of the specimen from its measured diffraction pattern. This quantitative phase imaging (QPI) method leverages two important innovations for bypassing the current limitations in the space-bandwidth product of traditional microscopy and ptychography methods for whole slide imaging (WSI) of biopsies. Ptychography uses aperture synthesis for bypassing the resolution limit of traditional microscopy techniques. Aperture synthesis combines information from a collection of sources to expand the Fourier passband and improve the achievable resolution. Ptychography is able to obtain a super-resolution that is ultimately limited only by the wavelength of the radiation used and not by the quality of optical lenses. In addition, this technique benefits from a large field-of-view and high-resolution, not seen in other biological microscopy techniques. [FPM RECONSTRUCTION SIMULATION] Image Stitching To construct our image panoramas, we will utilize computer vision and image processing techniques such as keypoint detection and local invariant descriptors; keypoint matching; RANSAC; and perspective warping. Pathware\u2019s panorama stitching algorithm consists of 5 steps: Detect keypoints (DoG, Harris, etc.) and extract local invariant descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.) from the two input images. Match the descriptors between the two images. Use the RANSAC algorithm to estimate a homography matrix using their matched feature vectors. Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers when outliers are to be accorded no influence on the values of the estimates. Therefore, it also can be interpreted as an outlier detection method. Apply a warping transformation using the homography matrix obtained from Step #3. Trim the unused pixels from the newly stitched image. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is an algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images. Lowe's method for image feature generation transforms an image into a large collection of feature vectors, each of which is invariant to image translation, scaling, and rotation, partially invariant to illumination changes and robust to local geometric distortion. Lowe used a modification of the k-d tree algorithm called the best-bin-first search method that can identify the nearest neighbors with high probability using only a limited amount of computation. Lowe rejected all matches in which the distance ratio is greater than 0.8, which eliminates 90% of the false matches while discarding less than 5% of the correct matches. To further improve the efficiency of the best-bin-first algorithm search was cut off after checking the first 200 nearest neighbor candidates. For a database of 100,000 key points, this provides a speedup over exact nearest neighbor search by about 2 orders of magnitude, yet results in less than a 5% loss in the number of correct matches. Lowe's SIFT-based object recognition gives excellent results except under wide illumination variations and under non-rigid transformations. Sample Images Resolution Pathware has been able to employ FPM in the Bioptic prototype to reconstruct images with a resolution down to 0.2 micrometers per pixel (Philips, the current leader in the space is only able to achieve 0.25 micrometers per pixel). We proved this by taking an image of a US Air Force Target as seen in Figure A. The USAF uses these targets to calibrate their laser systems since the individual dashes are of a known thickness in a way similar to that of a ruler. Figure B shows the area in the center of the target that they have enhanced with their technique with the final result shown in Figure C. The smallest lines under region 9 are only 0.55 microns thick.

A key feature of Bioptic's capabilities is that the recorded intensity images contain object information that is beyond the cutoff frequency of the collection optics \u2013 meaning that we are able to capture what a conventional brightfield microscope cannot. Our Image Capture Module is able to acquire images under different structured light patterns and is able to use the Fourier ptychographic algorithm to recover the super-resolution WSI and previously unknown illumination patterns.","title":"Spectral Illumination"},{"location":"pages/sci-tech/fpm/#fourier-ptychography","text":"Pytchography is the act of 'reconstructing' an object from a series of measured diffraction patterns. From a multitue Our friends and collaborators at the University of Connecticut have a fantastic introduction to FPM here and their explanation of the subject should be taken as ground truth. What is Ptychography? Ptychography Explained from Will Armson on Vimeo . If an object is illuminated with coherent electromagnetic radiation (e.g., visible light), a diffraction pattern is formed (related\u2013via the eponymous Fourier transform) to the optical transmission function of the object. The aim of ptychography is to directly reconstruct the original optical transmission function of the specimen from its measured diffraction pattern. This quantitative phase imaging (QPI) method leverages two important innovations for bypassing the current limitations in the space-bandwidth product of traditional microscopy and ptychography methods for whole slide imaging (WSI) of biopsies. Ptychography uses aperture synthesis for bypassing the resolution limit of traditional microscopy techniques. Aperture synthesis combines information from a collection of sources to expand the Fourier passband and improve the achievable resolution. Ptychography is able to obtain a super-resolution that is ultimately limited only by the wavelength of the radiation used and not by the quality of optical lenses. In addition, this technique benefits from a large field-of-view and high-resolution, not seen in other biological microscopy techniques.

Pathware\u2019s panorama stitching algorithm consists of 5 steps: Detect keypoints (DoG, Harris, etc.) and extract local invariant descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.) from the two input images. Match the descriptors between the two images. Use the RANSAC algorithm to estimate a homography matrix using their matched feature vectors. Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers when outliers are to be accorded no influence on the values of the estimates. Therefore, it also can be interpreted as an outlier detection method. Apply a warping transformation using the homography matrix obtained from Step #3. Trim the unused pixels from the newly stitched image. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is an algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images. Lowe's method for image feature generation transforms an image into a large collection of feature vectors, each of which is invariant to image translation, scaling, and rotation, partially invariant to illumination changes and robust to local geometric distortion. Lowe used a modification of the k-d tree algorithm called the best-bin-first search method that can identify the nearest neighbors with high probability using only a limited amount of computation. Lowe rejected all matches in which the distance ratio is greater than 0.8, which eliminates 90% of the false matches while discarding less than 5% of the correct matches. To further improve the efficiency of the best-bin-first algorithm search was cut off after checking the first 200 nearest neighbor candidates. For a database of 100,000 key points, this provides a speedup over exact nearest neighbor search by about 2 orders of magnitude, yet results in less than a 5% loss in the number of correct matches. Lowe's SIFT-based object recognition gives excellent results except under wide illumination variations and under non-rigid transformations.","title":"Image Stitching"},{"location":"pages/sci-tech/fpm/#sample-images","text":"","title":"Sample Images"},{"location":"pages/sci-tech/fpm/#resolution","text":"Pathware has been able to employ FPM in the Bioptic prototype to reconstruct images with a resolution down to 0.2 micrometers per pixel (Philips, the current leader in the space is only able to achieve 0.25 micrometers per pixel).

On the other hand, even greater optical resolution can be achieved by including dark-field images in the iterative reconstruction process. Enhanced Nyquist Sampling The Nyquist (Sampling) Theorem is a principle that engineers follow in the digitization of analog signals. For conversion from analogy to digital to result in an accurate reproduction fo the signal, slices (or samples) of the analog waveform must be taken frequently. The number of samples taken per second is called the sampling rate (or sampling frequency). Any analog signal consists of (wave) components at various frequencies. In the simplest case, a sine wave concentrates all of the signal energy into a single frequency. However, analog signals usually consist of complex waveforms, with (wave) components at several frequencies. The highest frequency component in an analog signal determines the bandwidth of that signal. As a result, the higher the sampling frequency, the greater the bandwidth (holding all other factors constant). Optical engineers use a concept called space-bandwidth product (SBP) to characterize the total resolvable pixels of an imaging system. By quantifying the combination of resolution and FOV by the SBP, engineers are calculating the number of pixels required to capture the full area at full resolution. In other words, this is just the FOV divided by the pixel size required to achieve Nyquist sampling at the resolution of the image. Solution to a Limited Space-Bandwidth Product In conventional microscopy, the SBPs of most off-the-shelf (OTS) objective lenses are around ~10 megapixels (MP). While 10 MP is reasonable for many applications, this resolution falls short of the gigapixel (GP) resolution needed for many biological applications. Ideally, an engineer could simply create a larger lens to increase the SBP. However, geometrical aberrations associated with the lens also scale up as the size of the lens increases. To solve this issue, one would need to introduce more optical surfaces to increase the degrees of freedom in lens optimization. These measures would complicate lens alignment and would be too costly for use in conventional microscopes. Furthermore, low magnification objective tend to perform much better than high magnification objectives at transmitting large amounts of information. The SBP scales as NA\u00b2/M\u00b2, and the magnification (M) goes up faster than the NA for high magnification lenses. In other words, most cameras do not have the resolution (pixel size) to capture all of the information passed by the low magnification objectives. So this extra magnification is needed to use the full resolution of a diffraction-limited lens. Second, current cameras do not have the necessary resolution to utilize the full resolution and full FOV of most objectives.

Applications include photographs with poor contrast due to glare, for example. Normalization is sometimes called contrast stretching or histogram stretching. In more general fields of data processing, such as digital signal processing, it is referred to as dynamic range expansion. [IMAGE?] Left: 40% decrease in gray scale intensity values, Center: Original Image, Right: 40% increase in gray scale intensity values The purpose of dynamic range expansion in the various applications is usually to bring the image, or other type of signal, into a range that is more familiar or normal to the senses, hence the term normalization. Often, the motivation is to achieve consistency in dynamic range for a set of data, signals, or images to avoid mental distraction or fatigue. For example, a newspaper will strive to make all of the images in an issue share a similar range of grayscale. The linear normalization of a grayscale digital image is performed according to the formula: $$I_N = (I - Min)\\frac{newMax-newMin}{Max-Min}+newMin$$ For example, if the intensity range of the image is 50 to 180 and the desired range is 0 to 255 the process entails subtracting 50 from each of pixel intensity, making the range 0 to 130. Then each pixel intensity is multiplied by 255/130, making the range 0 to 255. Normalization might also be non linear, this happens when there isn't a linear relationship between I and I(N) LED Positioning (including Defocus) Small changes in angle become large when they are propagated to large defocus depths, leading to reduced resolution and reconstruction artifacts. For example, using a well-aligned LED array will be unable to reconstruct high-resolution features of a resolution target defocused beyond 30 \u03bcm due to angle misalignment. Using the same data set, implementation of a self-calibration algorithm allows for reconstruction of high-resolution features even when there is up to 70 \u03bcm off-focus. [IMAGE?] Adapted from Waller, et al. Even small calibration errors degrade FPM resolution severely when defocus distances are large. Experimental schematic for a USAF target placed at varying defocus distances. Because iterative angle estimation (including SC calibration) unfeasibly increases the computational complexity of FPM, only bright field calibration is necessary. [IMAGES?] LED Intensity Fluctuations One of major systematic noises in FP settings comes from the illumination uncertainty of the multiple LED elements, a counter problem to the positional uncertainty in conventional ptychography settings. Specifically, this challenge comes from four aspects: 1) illumination intensities and incident angles of different LED elements are all different. We need to calibrate the intensities of different LED elements and measure their angular emission characteristics. 2) We also need to characterize the angular response of the light-collecting optics as well as the pixel point-spread-function of the image sensor. 3) In wide field-of-view settings, illumination intensity varies spatially across the entire field-of-view. Such spatial variations are also different for different LED elements. 4) Illumination intensities of different LED elements behave differently over time. In our FP prototype, we observe ~40% intensity drift for certain LED elements, over a time period of several hours. Note that, it is possible to alleviate the illumination uncertainty problem by developing a sophisticated calibration procedure with real-time intensity monitoring setups and associated time-synchronized electronics. However, this may require a substantial amount of maintenance efforts. As a result, adaptive system correction for FPM involves the evaluation of an image-quality metric at each iteration step, followed by the estimation of an improved system correction. This optimization process is repeated until the image-quality metric is maximized. [IMAGE?] The flow chart of the adaptive Fourier ptychographic algorithm for intensity correction. Aberration Correction Generally, the aberrations in an optical system can be decomposed into a set of Zernike polynomials, each with a different coefficient. Introduced by the Dutch scientist Fritz Zernike (Nobel prize laureate for the invention of phase-contrast microscope) in 1934, these polynomials can be applied to describe mathematically 3D wavefront deviation from what can be constructed as a plane - i.e. unit circle - of its zero mean, defined as a surface for which the sum of deviations on either side - opposite in sign one to another - equals zero. Each polynomial describes specific form of surface deviation; their combined sum can produce a large number of more complex surface shapes, that can be fit to specific forms of wavefront deviations (aberrations). In principle, by including sufficient number of Zernike polynomials (commonly referred to as terms), any wavefront deformation can be described to a desired degree of accuracy. The usual way of applying Zernike terms is to the specific wavefront shape, which is \"decomposed\" to a needed number of terms in order to determine: The main forms of contributing deviations, and The overall magnitude of deformation For simple aberration forms, such as pure Siedel aberrations, a single polynomial suffices. Describing more complex aberrations, such as, for instance, seeing error, as well as wavefronts formed by actual (i.e. imperfect) surfaces, requires an expanded set of Zernike polynomials. Zernike polynomials define deviations from zero mean as a function of the radial point height \u03c1 in the unit-radius circle and its angular circle coordinate \u03b8, which is the setting of a microscope exit pupil, in which the wavefront form is evaluated. In polar and Cartesian coordinates, respectively, the radial component is \u03c1\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, with 0 \u2264 \u03c1, x, y \u2264 1. The common convention for the angular coordinate \u03b8 varies with the field; in ophthalmology, it is counterclockwise from x+ toward y+ axis (OSA recommended), thus \u03c1 = x/cos\u03b8 = y/sin\u03b8. In general optics, it is often different. Malacara's convention is clockwise from y+ to x+ axis, thus \u03c1 = x/sin\u03b8 = y/cos\u03b8, and Mahajan's convention (Optical imaging and aberrations) applied here to the conventional aberration functions is counterclockwise from y+ to x-, hence with the same radial-to-angular relations as Malacara's. The polynomials are orthogonal (i.e. their values change independently) over the circle of unit radius. Due to this attribute, these aberration forms are termed orthogonal, or Zernike aberrations. [ABBERATION CORRECTION IMAGE] As mentioned, zero mean is defined as a surface for which the sum of wavefront deviations to either side is zero. That is important conceptual difference vs. standard wavefront error, which expresses deviations from a reference sphere (also commonly constructed as a circle). Hence the polynomial, which is a product of its radial variable in \u03c1 and angular variable in \u03b8 , has zero value at the intersection of the wavefront and its zero mean. Zero mean differs from the reference sphere for balanced primary spherical aberration and defocus, while coinciding with it for balanced primary astigmatism. coma and balanced 6th/4th order spherical. As a result, the form of polynomial is different from the classical aberration function for the former three, while identical (except for the normalization factor) for the latter two. The polynomial normalization factor fulfils the formal requirement that the radial polynomial portion equals 1 for \u03c1=1. For instance, the deviation from zero mean for primary spherical aberration \u2013 whose polynomial only has the radial component \u2013 is given by \u03c14-\u03c12+1/6; thus, its normalization factor is 6, and the corresponding Zernike circle polynomial is 6\u03c14-6\u03c12+1 (this normalization to unit radius shouldn't be confused with normalization to unit variance, described ahead). Orthogonality of Zernike polynomials creates the possibility to combine as many different surfaces as needed to approximate the form of wavefront deviation with desired accuracy. It allows expressing separate contributions of various forms of aberrations - including any chosen extent of the higher order forms - and obtaining the combined variance as the sum of individual aberration variances. Also, the polynomials can be - and routinely are - scaled to unit variance over the circle radius for all aberration forms, so that their combined form can be determined directly by adding up their expansion coefficients, which determine the specific magnitude for each aberration form. Wavefront is described as a sum of Zernike aberration terms. Zernike Wavefront Figure In the nutshell, the normalization factor N is chosen so that a product of the sum of two extreme values of the polynomial (absolute values, determining the relative magnitude of P-V deviation) and normalization factor equals the P-V-to-RMS wavefront error ratio for the aberration. Hence, multiplying this product with the expansion coefficient - which equals the RMS error for given aberration-yields the P-V wavefront error corresponding to the coefficient. For any value of the polynomial for given pupil coordinate \u03c1, a product with the normalization factor and expansion coefficient yields, as already mentioned, the wavefront deviation from zero mean for that particular pupil coordinate. As with the standard aberrations, the wavefront error, either P-V (as a direct optical path difference) or RMS, is directly related - although not necessarily identical - to the phase error. The absolute value of Zernike expansion coefficient z(nm) is identical to the RMS wavefront error; since the coefficient does express positive and negative deviations, the sum of coefficients for all Zernike terms used to fit particular wavefront gives its overall RMS wavefront error (i.e. standard deviation), and its square equals the wavefront variance.

Aberration Reconstruction Figure","title":"Aberration Correction"},{"location":"pages/strategy/competition/","text":"Pathware Inc.\u2019s competition can be broken down into four general categories: No Quality Assessment, Manual Quality Assessment, Tele-pathology, and Whole Slide Scanning. No Assessment No tissue quality assessment makes up most of the market. A majority of biopsies take place in more remote, outpatient settings where cytopathologists are not available to assess the quality of the sample before the patient leaves. When the cost of providing a cytotechnologist or pathologist on-site during the procedure is prohibitive, most clinics send samples to pathologists without assessment. This makes them ineligible for Reimbursement & Price Modeling for the assessment procedure itself and susceptible to losing money if the procedure needs to be repeated. Disadvantages The primary drawback to this method is that 20% of these procedures must be repeated, causing delays in diagnoses and with the cost of the additional procedure(s) being ineligible for Reimbursement & Price Modeling Manual Assessment Mobile lab carts allow a pathologist to attend the procedure and assess the tissue\u2019s quality at the time of its collection. These carts are cumbersome to maneuver across the hospital and the assessment process significantly increases procedure time resulting in lost time for both the surgeon and pathologist\u2019s valuable billing time. Milestone SRL Developers of the roseSTATION, a mobile lab cart system. Use of this system requires a pathologist or cytopathologist to be physically present to evaluate the slide after each pass. Located in Milan, Italy Disadvantages With 4-5 passes required per biopsy, this additional step adds approximately 50 minutes to each procedure and requires the added cost of the pathologist or cytopathologist's time. Additionally, the cost of setting up a mobile pathology lab station can range from $75k-$200k. Tele-pathology Larger hospitals employ tele-pathology tools to keep their pathologist in the lab while having a technician at the point-of-care to prepare the sample for assessment remotely. While this saves the time of the pathologist in transit, it does not address the challenges of the manual assessment as it requires even more time and people to implement. Furthermore, remote assessments are not reimbursable under the current coding scheme. Instapath Developed a tool to image core needle tissue biopsies for telepathology interpretation of adequacy which is currently outside of Pathware\u2019s market. This solution provides a method for manual assessment offsite. Their core technology is reliant on a specialized operator onsite to prepare the sample and offsite pathologists for interpretation. Located in Houston, TX Disadvantages Drawbacks to this solution include the cost of clinician time (8-10 minutes per sample) needed to prepare and evaluate the sample. As compared to Pathware, their pricing model is out of scope for much of Pathware's target market at $100k capital expense for the microscope, $200 per procedure in disposables, and $100 monthly subscription per user for their software. Clarapath Providers of high-throughput slide digitization services. Their solution provides the service of digitizing and storing large amounts of slides efficiently. Located in New York, NY Disadvantages They do not provide a point-of-care device or otherwise provide slide adequacy assessment or evaluation services as a part of their product. They are a newer competitor to the marketplace and appear to be focused specifically on providing efficient workflow solutions. Mikroscan Provides a workflow solution that incorporates on-site manual slide preparation with a telepathology solution to provide remote adequacy evaluations. Located in Carlsbad, CA Disadvantages This adds 45 minutes to the workflow during a biopsy procedure. Image acquisition requires approximately 10 minutes. This solution still requires the time of a pathologist or cytotechnologist to prepare, stain, and evaluate the slide for adequacy. Hologic Manufacturer of ThinPrep Pap Test, which is an end-to-end diagnostic solution for pap smears. This includes a liquid-based preparation kit for clinicians to preserve cell samples from pap smears at the point of care for further analysis at the path lab. For pathology labs, Hologic produces an automatic slide-preparation machine that is compatible with its liquid-based vials, and a diagnostic imager that flags cell clusters of interest for a pathologist to make a diagnosis. In the United States, ThinPrep is the standard product for the preparation and analysis of pap smears. Located in Marlborough, MA Disadvantages This solution does not provide adequacy evaluations or the ability to scan and store slides and is applicable only to pap smear samples. Additionally, the equipment is massive and stationary in the laboratory keeping them from integrating at the point-of-care. Whole Slide Imaging Systems Whole Slide Scanning platforms are indirect competition: these technologies are laboratory-based and have no quality assessment component. These systems do not address to this market need and are well beyond the budget of most hospitals at $1.0MM per unit. Leica Biosystems Makers of Aperio slide scanners and currently are the market leaders for scanners, with each of their units starting at $30,000. The machines themselves can be small enough to fit on a desk, but only generate a small 15mmx15mm image to which a remote pathologist is able to view. Located in Wetzlar, Germany Disadvantages By definition, this is not a \"whole slide\" image (WSI) as it is only 15mmx15mm (~12% of the Bioptic Unit\u2019s field of view). Furthermore, Aperio scanners rely on a method that involves highly sensitive moving equipment to scan and digitize the slide This method not only takes longer to produce the final image, it is also only able to image samples that are extremely flat due to the razor thin focal range. This tendency to fall in and out of focus makes it incapable of imaging cytology images without employing secondary imaging measures (e.g. z-stacking) which brings an additional time cost, exponentially larger file sizes, and higher equipment costs. While Aperio does offer a unit with \u201creal-time\u201d viewing to pathologists, this model tends to have delayed and clunky interfaces that do not fit into the normal workflow of how pathologists view and assess samples. Additionally, Aperio does not currently offer slide assessment as part of their scanner capabilities, meaning that it would require an additional pathologist to be readily available for tissue assessment every time a tissue sample is extracted. Philips Healthcare Manufacturers of the first WSI scanner approved to market as a diagnostic instrument. Located in Best, Netherlands Disadvantage These scanners are physically large (taking up approximately twelve cubic feet of space and weigh more than 120 kg). Storage of slides requires the separate acquisition and set up of data storage systems that must be maintained by trained technical personnel staffed by the individual institution. The large form factor also prevents these units from being a practical point-of-care device. Scanning speeds are only as fast as 3 minutes per slide and limited to histology samples due to the limitations imposed by their line imaging techniques which is outside of the scope of Pathware\u2019s market segment. In addition, the cost of acquiring and setting up these units is approximately $1 million per unit which is well beyond the available budget for the majority of the market. [INSERT SCANNER COMPARISON HERE] [DETAILED ECOSYSTEM MAP] Competitive Advantages What is the distinct competitive advantage? NOT A GOOD ANSWER / CHANGE NEEDED The biggest competitive advantage is the versatility of the platform due to the digital slide cloud integration. In addition to the improvements, the Bioptic\u2122 unit makes over current industry standards, it can easily develop secondary software applications that allow us to organically generate additional revenue from already established accounts. This coupled with being the first movers to this unaddressed market allows us to set the standard for future digital pathology adoption. Once fully integrated into the clinical workflow with our suite of services, all future market entrants will have to be funneled through our slide management system. This gives us ownership of the flow of information between labs and physicians. In addition to this, the experienced sales leaders lined up to bring on at the soft and full launch will provide us with the edge necessary to confirm deal closures. What are the incentives and barriers to entry? NOT A GOOD ANSWER / CHANGE NEEDED The main barriers to entry faced by Pathware Inc are brand recognition challenges, tariffs and quotas, the need for specialized patents and technology, finding qualified employees, government regulations, and quality validation. Our team plans to leverage existing relationships with established clinics and health systems to spread awareness of Bioptic\u2122 and its functionality. Positioning our early adopting accounts as references sites that will be used to leverage as they scale into the market. The credibility of these institutions and the financial impact data that will be collected throughout the integration of the technology will prove to be invaluable assets to prove value for mass market adoption. Additionally, our team will attend trade shows and conferences (DPA, CAP, etc.) to further build brand recognition. With regards to tariffs and quotas, Bioptic\u2122 will be priced to account for these tariffs while still being significantly less expensive than current technology solutions. Our team has already filed multiple patents and has developed device functionality for the primary market (FNA quality assessment). The Pathware team also plans to utilize current relationships within the Michigan and Washington healthcare and entrepreneurship communities to continue seeking out qualified employees that fit the company\u2019s needs. Additionally, there are stringent government regulations placed on the classification and use of medical devices. Pathware is marketing Bioptic\u2122 as a Class II Device that is not a diagnostic tool to avoid burdensome regulatory limitations. Lastly, quality validation of a medical device is essential to market acceptance and early adoption. Pathware has already secured accredited health systems and clinics to begin clinical validation of the product across a wide array of tissue types. Our team plans to use the results and recommendations from these institutions to reach a wider group of clinics to further validate the product. What prevents a competitor from responding or imitating? NOT A GOOD ANSWER / CHANGE NEEDED The threat of a new entry in the near term is relatively low due to technical, regulatory, and Intellectual Property barriers in place and the niche nature of the market. Specifically, Pathware has worked with multiple law firms to ensure the claims in our filings are robust and protectable. However, we recognize that it is reasonable to expect competitors to enter the market space once the opportunity is highlighted as they begin generating significant traction in 2021/2022. The technical challenges of developing a similar unit are not insurmountable by a well-funded engineering team and the regulatory burden is relatively low as a laboratory instrument. We plan to continue expanding our IP portfolio, but there is a significant amount of legal room in the space being that the technique is less than five years old with very few patents on record. That being the case, the goal is to saturate the market with the Bioptic\u2122 as quickly and efficiently as possible as hospitals are reluctant to change unless there is a magnitude of improvement over the current technique that they are using. Furthermore, incorporating additional indications for the use of the platform to cement our position in the hospital while expanding revenue opportunities.

Threat of Substitution Overall, the threat of substitution by another technique or platform is remarkably low. The only other options available in today\u2019s marketplace are the manual assessment or no assessment at all. While it is not impossible for an institution to revert to their previous techniques, it is unlikely as hospitals resist rapid changes in protocols. Unless their technology is significantly underperforming on the financial metrics that the hospital is seeking or results in negative patient outcomes, hospitals and physicians will resist changing again until there is a significantly better solution available. Bargaining Power of Buyers In the United States, there are approximately 230,187 physician practices. Of these practices, 50% are single office physicians, 47% have less than 10 physicians, and the remaining 3% support 10 or more physicians. The AHA recognizes 5,500 Accredited Hospitals which all would be potential customers of the Bioptic platform. Of the 5,500 Hospitals, 1,500 are large cancer-oriented hospitals, and 62 are NCI Cancer Centers who process thousands of samples every day. These 5,562 often serve as the pathology services of smaller community hospitals which makes up about 60% of their pathology workload daily. Additionally, there are 1,243 Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics across the country that would viable customers of the technology. Being that the VA is the largest network of hospitals in the nation and has preferred buyer status due to government regulations, they can exert the highest amount of influence on the sales prices. Pathware team\u2019s extensive experience selling into these accounts enables them to avoid any pitfalls that this position may present. The relatively large number and diversity of hospitals and clinics across the country enable them to avoid burdensome buyer negotiations around price points. The trend towards consolidation of medical practices in the market increases the bargaining power of their clients, but this will have a minimal impact on the business in the near term as the clear majority (97%) of the market has fewer than 10 physicians in the practice. Pathware Inc. can further diversify this risk by incorporating the 20,000 Hospitals recognized by the World Health Organization and the 26,000 US Animal Hospitals all of which are potential customers of the platform. Bargaining Power of Suppliers The components that comprise the Bioptic\u2122 platform are relatively simple in nature and widely accessible in the market from a variety of suppliers. Examples being their LED arrays, boards, digital screens, plastic components, and motors. These points of flexibility allow for greater negotiation power from suppliers as they scale. However, there are two components that are directly dependent upon a single supplier: Sony\u2019s CMOS sensor and Nvidia\u2019s Jetson Module. At the time of writing this business plan, Sony is the only producer of these highly specialized CMOS sensors with pixel sizes small enough for cellular imaging with their microscopy technique. As technology continues to develop, they anticipate this apparent monopoly on the market to open as companies such as Canon continue to make advancements. Nvidia is dominating the computer vision processor market space with very little competition. Pathware Inc. is currently utilizing the second generation TX2 Jetson module for their proof-of-concept testing with plans to upgrade to their third generation AGX Xavier module for market rollout. While they are limited by a single supplier, they can diversify the risk by being able to work with multiple generations of their processors in the unlikely event of price increases down the road. Both companies are well established in the market and unlikely to go out of business giving confidence in a stable supply chain for the foreseeable future. Rivalry amongst Existing Competitors Pathware\u2019s primary competition in the industry today fall into three categories: No Quality Assessment, Manual Quality Assessment, and Tele-pathology Assessment. Much of the market (93-95%) opt for No Quality Assessment and simply take multiple samples from the potentially cancerous lesion to collect an adequate sample. The challenge with this technique is that the samples will grow increasingly clouded with pooling blood, fibrous matter, and extraneous fluid every time that the needle is passed through the tissue. It is this technique that leads to the 1 in 5 chance that the patient will have to return in the future to repeat the procedure. The only other option in the market is to implement a mobile cart station where someone can be on site to prepare and assess the sample before the patient is discharged. In the Manual Quality Assessment process, institutions will have their specialized cytopathologist carry a sizable mobile lab station down to the biopsy suite or operating room. This care will equip them to prepare, stain, and assess the sample to ensure that a quality sample is extracted to mitigate the 1 in 5 chance of failure. Companies such as Milestone SRL create these carts, but most hospitals prefer to create their lab stations in-house as it is more flexible for needs while also being more cost effective. Overall, only 5-7% of the market has integrated this procedure into their workflows due to cost and personnel limitations. Aiming to address the personnel challenges of the manual assessment, some institutions have implemented tools such as Skype Business and Apple\u2019s FaceTime into their microscope carts to allow lower cost technicians onsite to prepare the sample allowing remote consultation from the pathologist. The potential transit time savings for the pathologist are challenging to justify with increased equipment costs, added personnel, and longer procedures which mean only a few very large academic institutions have implemented this technique. At the writing of this business plan, there are no fully automated solutions targeting this issue with biopsy quality available on the market giving Pathware a low-risk competitive landscape and greater negotiating power with their customers.","title":"Porter's Five Forces"},{"location":"pages/strategy/porters-forces/#porters-five-forces","text":"","title":"Porter's Five Forces"},{"location":"pages/strategy/porters-forces/#threat-of-new-entrants","text":"The threat of a new entry in the near term is relatively low due to technical, regulatory, and Intellectual Property barriers in place and the niche nature of the market.

While they are limited by a single supplier, they can diversify the risk by being able to work with multiple generations of their processors in the unlikely event of price increases down the road. Both companies are well established in the market and unlikely to go out of business giving confidence in a stable supply chain for the foreseeable future.","title":"Bargaining Power of Suppliers"},{"location":"pages/strategy/porters-forces/#rivalry-amongst-existing-competitors","text":"Pathware\u2019s primary competition in the industry today fall into three categories: No Quality Assessment, Manual Quality Assessment, and Tele-pathology Assessment. Much of the market (93-95%) opt for No Quality Assessment and simply take multiple samples from the potentially cancerous lesion to collect an adequate sample. The challenge with this technique is that the samples will grow increasingly clouded with pooling blood, fibrous matter, and extraneous fluid every time that the needle is passed through the tissue. It is this technique that leads to the 1 in 5 chance that the patient will have to return in the future to repeat the procedure. The only other option in the market is to implement a mobile cart station where someone can be on site to prepare and assess the sample before the patient is discharged. In the Manual Quality Assessment process, institutions will have their specialized cytopathologist carry a sizable mobile lab station down to the biopsy suite or operating room. This care will equip them to prepare, stain, and assess the sample to ensure that a quality sample is extracted to mitigate the 1 in 5 chance of failure. Companies such as Milestone SRL create these carts, but most hospitals prefer to create their lab stations in-house as it is more flexible for needs while also being more cost effective. Overall, only 5-7% of the market has integrated this procedure into their workflows due to cost and personnel limitations. Aiming to address the personnel challenges of the manual assessment, some institutions have implemented tools such as Skype Business and Apple\u2019s FaceTime into their microscope carts to allow lower cost technicians onsite to prepare the sample allowing remote consultation from the pathologist. The potential transit time savings for the pathologist are challenging to justify with increased equipment costs, added personnel, and longer procedures which mean only a few very large academic institutions have implemented this technique. At the writing of this business plan, there are no fully automated solutions targeting this issue with biopsy quality available on the market giving Pathware a low-risk competitive landscape and greater negotiating power with their customers.","title":"Rivalry amongst Existing Competitors"},{"location":"pages/strategy/product-market-fit/","text":"How is This Product Different? No company to date has fully automated the rapid on-site evaluation process. Pathware automates the image acquisition and subsequent analysis. Several companies have attempted to alleviate the financial burden that having a pathologist in the biopsy suite incurs and have implemented tele-pathology workflows but have failed to realize that having pathologists involved in such a routine task as ROSE, in any manner, is a financial strain. We have opted for full automation, from slide handling to image analysis, to quality assessment and file management; no one else has. A large part of this is due to the adaptation of NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPU technology, which allows for an immense number of computer vision processes to be run simultaneously, effectively rendering analysis instantaneous. No other company has anywhere near the processing power they harnessed built into our scanning systems. The Bioptic unit has four main advantages over competitors to consider: The size of the unit will fit on a desktop work area \u2013 more manageable than a mobile cart of massive lab unit. The price of the unit (at $20K) is an order of magnitude less than other scanners (some running as high as $1MM). The time needed to process cytological samples is less than 5 minutes \u2013 far faster than current industry standards. The Bioptic System does not need stains or contrast agents to create a Whole Slide Image. The Future is FNA At Pathware, we have created a stainless whole slide scanner that is able to image both histology and cytology samples. Being that the histology space is quickly becoming overcrowded with players like Philips and Leica, we have focused our efforts on improving the diagnostic utility of cytology samples where there are currently no competitors on the market. With the Bioptic\u2122, we are able to standardize the FNA procedure regardless of staffing or geography of a hospital system. By enhancing the diagnostic utility of this minimally invasive technique, we are riding a wave of sentiment in the field of medicine: that minimally invasive practice is the future, much in the same way that we are seeing surgeries shift to a greater emphasis on laparoscopic procedures. Why Fine-needle Aspirated Biopsies? Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) is a cytologic methodology of extracting a sample for diagnosis. During this procedure, a clinician will guide an incredibly thin needle (typically 22-gauge) into a mass and apply negative pressure to a syringe to collect a fluidic sample of cells from an area of interest. That sample is then smeared between two glass slides, stained and assessed by a sub-specialized cytopathologist to render a diagnosis. This is a relatively young technique in the clinical workflow that was pioneered in the 1980\u2019s as a minimally invasive biopsy technique when compared to core needle or excisional biopsies. FNA procedures were rapidly adopted across the globe due to the significant decrease in complications, its utility in outpatient settings, and the cost-effective nature of the procedure. However, this technique experienced pushback in the early 2000\u2019s due to issues with non-diagnostic samples that were leading to delayed or even incorrect diagnoses. It was in this time period that a technique of Rapid On-site Evaluation (ROSE) was developed to verify the quality of a biopsy sample at the point of extraction to improve the diagnostic yield. Many studies show that ROSE increases the diagnostic reliability of FNA to match that of Core Needles, but the majority of hospitals could not afford the specialized personnel and equipment to implement this gold standard clinical practice. Today, the FNA procedure is primarily used to extract samples from risky or highly-sensitive lesions due to its remarkably low rate of complications. Specifically, FNAs are the primary method of thyroid/oral cavity masses (due to nerves and major arteries), pancreas and deep gut lymph nodes (due to risk of bowel puncture and septic shock). The utility of FNAs is still hotly debated; in the case of lung tissue, core needle biopsies have a higher rate of complications such as pneumothorax (i.e. collapsed lung) while FNAs run the risk of not gathering enough sample for diagnosis \u2013 subjecting the patient to more procedures and concomitantly delaying the diagnosis. The use of FNAs in tissues such as breast, where the risk of major complication is lower than other areas, are also thoroughly debated. Oftentimes, the surgeon will use an FNA to localize and characterize a lesion to better place the core needle and maximize the quality of the sample collected. Other tissues such as prostate are exclusively biopsied by core needle due to the low risk of major complication and the challenge of missing the diagnosis is greater. Current clinical practice is largely weighted as a balance of risk: although an FNA procedure has little-to-no complications, missing the tissue could lead to a delayed or inaccurate diagnosis. Today, clinicians err on the side of collecting more tissue if possible. This results in about 25% of biopsies being performed as an FNA and the remaining 75% done by core needle. While there are whole pathology slide scanners available on the market today with software to image and classify cells in a sample, nearly all of these platforms are focused on the histology market. Histology is where a large chunk of tissue is collected (core needle or excisional biopsies), encased in a wax block, and sliced to an exact thickness, and mounted on a glass slide for staining and assessment by a pathologist to render a diagnosis. These scanners and software packages are only applicable to the histology markets due to their inability to handle the variance in the thickness of the sample that is seen when you create a cytology smear \u2013 their camera systems are unable to compensate for the extreme variance in z-axial (focal plane) depth and focusing issues render histology image capture processes unreliable for cytology. Some scanners have implemented a technique called z-stacking: a process of taking images at multiple heights to account for this variance, consequently increasing file size and the time needed to scan a slide. In most cases: a full order of magnitude to 10-15 minutes per slide. We at Pathware firmly believe that the future is FNA, as it represents the most minimally invasive biopsy technique possible. The future diagnostic workflow envisioned by major players in the space (ex: J&J) is to have a patient come into the hospital for a robotically guided biopsy, diagnose the patient onsite, and ablate any tumor immediately so that the patient does not need to return to the hospital multiple times for multiple procedures. This workflow is only possible if you are able to diagnose at the point-of-care which is the value of cytology over histology. Histology requires equipment to encase in wax, section the tissue, mount and stain the sample, and image the sample which makes this near impossible. Frozen sections destroy the tissue for later diagnostic applications and are only used in extreme cases where you need to identify clean margins. Additionally, frozen sections can take hours to perform barring this from a viable application long-term. Cytology is perfectly positioned to collect, prepare, and diagnose a sample at the point-of-care, and we are building the Bioptic\u2122 platform to be the front runner in this automated workflow. Additionally, since the Bioptic\u2122 is a stainless imaging platform, the entire sample remains viable for downstream genomic sequencing for targeted cancer therapy development. There are other biopsy techniques being developed that have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to detect cancers at earlier stages and intervene before they metastasize. Specifically, I am referring to blood biopsies which have received a significant amount of hype over the past decade as the silver bullet to cancer detection. We believe that this technology has the ability to dramatically improve the quality of care that we are able to provide cancer patients. However, we do believe that the abilities of these tests are significantly overstated compared to what it will likely become over time. In order to achieve the end goal of a coming to a primary diagnosis and starting treatment off of a blood biopsy, you would need to systematically destroy two specialties of medicine (Radiology and Pathology), both of which are profit centers for hospitals. Additionally, you would need to bypass decades of established literature, drug development, and clinical education that are built off of radiology and pathology findings to be able to effectively overhaul the clinical workflow in this way. That being said, I only see two ways that this technique is widely adopted: Cancer Screening and Recurrence Tracking. In the screening scenario, the clinician would draw the blood biopsy of high-risk (i.e. smoking, family history, etc.) patients in the outpatient setting at their regular checkup. If circulating tumor cells are detected, the patient would then be funneled into the existing workflow of radiology imaging, biopsy, and diagnosis. In the case of recurrence tracking, a clinician would opt to perform a blood biopsy rather than an x-ray or low dose CT scan for the regular review of cancer patients after their treatment has completed. In this way, we would be able to identify a recurrence sooner and fast track treatment as we would already be on high alert as to where to look due to the patient's history. In all likelihood, the patient would still undergo the standard radiology imaging, biopsy, and diagnosis as a precautionary measure. Lastly, it is important to note that clinicians perform biopsies for a variety of ailments from cysts to infertility testing of which the blood biopsy technique would not rule out. The argument that blood biopsy will decrease the number of invasive biopsies performed is valid, but the likelihood that it will replace the procedure altogether is astronomically low. Lastly, there are imaging techniques that are being developed to classify and diagnose tumors based on tags that are illuminated in an MRI or CT. These techniques are being presented as a way to circumvent the biopsy process and move straight into treatment. The challenge with this argument is that all of our therapeutic decisions are made on the cellular architecture and genomic level which would be lost in this technique. Additionally, you would be removing all profits of the pathology workflow. The pushback from these two factors cannot be overstated as the medical field prefers evolutionary change to revolutionary change to the workflow. In short, the field of pathology is about to experience a significant evolution on par with what we have already seen take place in the field of radiology. Today, all pathology slides are handled manually in the same way that radiologists used to hold x-rays up to a light. Our current approach to pathology is time consuming and labor intensive which is already over strained with an aging population and steadily declining pathology workforce. With 63% of pathologists planning on retiring in the next decade, and fewer medical students entering the field in the first place, we are about to reach a breaking point without proper support and intervention from computer-based decision support tools. Cytology is the most time, resource, and cost-effective method of diagnosis. As we have seen in other fields, this coming decade will see continued integration of automated tools to improve throughput and outcomes. We at Pathware are positioned to set the stage for the future diagnostic workflow as we work to make point-of-care pathology a reality. Financial Factors Follow-on products or services?

Once established in the US Market, expansion plans take aim at international markets by integrating into South Korean hospitals ($243MM opportunity). Then expansion into additional Asian and European markets with a team consisting of extensive life science and medical device sales experience. The initial positioning of the unit as a decision support tool as opposed to a diagnostic tool is critical for initial adoption by institutions and clinicians. Rather than replacing the pathologist in the room, Pathware\u2019s message will be to support the diagnostic workflow by providing higher quality samples and enabling the pathologist to focus efforts towards more lucrative and impactful lab-based diagnostic tests. Secondarily, this non-diagnostic position means that the data handled by the Bioptic\u2122 unit is lower risk information. Further, the unidirectional push of information to the EHR should present a decreased exposure for the IT infrastructure of the institution. Access to hospitals and healthcare facilities purchasing decision makers is very complicated to accomplish with many barriers from federal legislation on money spent to influence, and the facilities own hierarchy (firewall) systems. Once beta trials are completed and data collected providing validity to ROI models, adoption workflow process, and value proposition to hospitals, Rodger Moore, current VP of Sales at Philips Healthcare has agreed to come on full time as VP of Sales. His experience in this sector will be incredibly valuable to the company and the plan is for him to familiarize himself and test the product sales process in full. The goal for Rodger is to pursue at least fifteen health institutions as the companies first sales and marketing professional. Specifically, they will target the Director of the Department of Pathology in larger academic Cancer Centers to purchase the Bioptic\u2122. These initial accounts are targeted as they are thought-leading institutions who have an interest in having pathology assessments performed onsite. In 2020, the goal is to hire three healthcare proven sales associates to their outside sales division to establish accounts with at least 15 Cancer Centers. The plan will then overlay 10 inside sales representatives to reach the 1,500 CoC Accredited Cancer Centers and 4,000 community hospitals and private practices. By 2022, Pathware Inc\u2019s goal is to have established a partnership with a private clinical laboratory such as Quest Diagnostics to standardize biopsy collection in smaller institutions and outpatient clinics. These accounts have fewer decision makers resulting in a significantly shorter sales cycle of two months. Initial Launch Identify a Clinician Champion Pathware Inc. is in the process of identifying clinicians that can best support the need for biopsy quality assessment and will work with them to identify and create journal studies showing major support for the addition of this technology into the pathology setting. This, in turn, will garner support from the decision makers at their institutions. These physicians need to understand and support the clinical value that Bioptic\u2122 brings to their institutions and practice. These champions will likely fall into the following profiles. In Order of Preference: Director of Cytopathology (ex: Liron Pantanowitz, MD ) Director of Pathology (ex: David Chhieng, MD ) Director of Radiology (ex: Sam Gambhir, MD ) Evaluation Phase Larger hospitals have Value Committees that review major purchasing decisions at their institution. They are typically made up of one or more of the following personnel: Purchasing, Quality, Patient Satisfaction, Biomedical Engineering, IT. Their decision to purchase is based on the clinical, financial, and operational benefit of a product. By having the clinical support of a department chair and pricing the unit well below the purchase threshold that these committees are typically presented with, they should be able to secure contracts relatively quickly compared to the industry average. Medium sized hospitals, the evaluation, and purchasing decision will likely be in the hands of the department chair since the price point would easily fit into their operational budget rather than a capital expense. They would likely need to see adoption at other institutions first as they are risk-averse. Smaller hospitals may have a diverse committee of 4-5 that reviews all purchase contracts for their facility. Due to their size, they will likely be able to move faster than their larger counterparts. Their evaluation typically revolves around the financial outcomes of the purchasing decision. Adoption & Integration This process will largely vary based on institutional protocols and personnel. The initial product will be basic in nature and will not interact with the EHR allowing the integration to be relatively streamlined. Detailed onsite training for the first 15 accounts and virtual demonstrations, online training modules pre-launch of the inside sales/support division and scale into the market space. Pathware has prepared a detailed and scalable sales protocol that is outlined below. Phase I of this outline began October 2020 with Phase III beginning January 2021. Sales Protocol Preparation Duration: 12 Months Pre-sale Duration: 3 Months Closing Duration: 1 Account Per Month Post-sale Ongoing... Detailed Sales Information What is the company\u2019s go-to-market strategy? The marketing plan for Pathware\u2019s Bioptic\u2122 unit is built on completion of winter 2019 beta trials. At product launch, the per month sales and marketing budget will be $30,000 in Mar. 2020 and climb steadily in proportion to revenue of $4.1MM by the end of 2023. Specifically, we will start by targeting the Director of the Department of Pathology in larger academic Cancer Centers will provide key opinion pieces (literature, key studies, leading journal articles) along with Trade show speaking events to ignite a marketing drive in the industry. These thought-leading institutions will provide the certification of the Bioptic\u2122 workflow efficiency and show patient overall satisfaction increases with positive outcomes. As the company grows a hybrid sales force (inside and outside) aim to establish accounts with relationships with at least 15 Cancer Centers. Then address 1,500 CoC Accredited Cancer Centers and 4,000 community hospitals and private practices. By 2022, Pathware Inc.\u2019s goal is to have established a partnership with a private clinical laboratory such as Quest Diagnostics to standardize biopsy collection in smaller institutions and outpatient clinics. Once established in the US Market, expansion plans take aim at international markets by integrating into South Korean hospitals ($243MM opportunity).

The initial positioning of the unit as a decision support tool as opposed to a diagnostic tool is critical for initial adoption by institutions and clinicians. Rather than replacing the pathologist in the room, Pathware\u2019s message will be to support the diagnostic workflow by providing higher quality samples and enabling the pathologist to focus efforts towards more lucrative and impactful lab-based diagnostic tests. Secondarily, this non-diagnostic position means that the data handled by the Bioptic\u2122 unit is lower risk information. Further, the unidirectional push of information to the EHR should present a decreased exposure for the IT infrastructure of the institution. What are the market size, growth, and rate of growth? Primarily the 3.3M Fine Needle Aspiration biopsies are the focus in the US market for Bioptic\u2122. This market represents 4,840 community hospitals, 1,500 cancer centers as well as academic and research institutions leading to $443M in unit sales (assuming 3.5 units per account). With an average of $200 of revenue generated from each biopsy procedure and $20k per Bioptic\u2122 unit, this collection represents a $1.4B annuity-based market opportunity. Initially, efforts focus on thyroid biopsies ($156M) due to the relatively low clinical risk and clear market pull for this application. Once established in the thyroid biopsy market, expansion into other tissues such as breast ($325M) and lung ($310M). The technology will then be deployed for lymph node, liver, pancreatic, and GI biopsies ($570M). The planned start with lung cancer is Q1 of 2020 followed by breast cancer in Q2 2020. We plan to rapidly expand into these adjacent segments because these biopsies are performed by the same departments with similar needs to the initial thyroid application. With plans for international expansion, the global market opportunity totals $3.6B, based on the current FNA procedure volume (5% CAGR). Pathware\u2019s total Addressable Market amounts to $12.8B based on FNA usage across global market spaces. Progress towards this total opportunity is achieved by first focusing on the North American region due to proximity and networks already in place. Pathware Inc. is in discussions with seasoned international sales personnel in the life science industry to streamline our expansion into the European and Asian market spaces. To effectively saturate these markets while maintaining the first-mover advantage, a plan to raise a Series B and Series C of $12M and $25M respectively over the next five years is in place. Both these rounds will be at a stage where the company is post profitability enabling more favorable terms for growth and late stage capital. As a general trend, the market is moving in the direction of digital pathology with an estimated $1B in 2018 sales. The Digital Pathology Market is projected to reach $8.66B with a 14.8% CAGR by 2023 . Moreover, collaboration in the medical space will continue its shift toward a virtual environment from a physical one particularly as the number of pathologists, globally, continue to shrink. Pathware believes that this will represent a shift into the Telemedicine market which was valued at $26.5B in 2018 and will exceed $41B by 2021 . Complete Market Opportunity Calculator.xlsx Current Customers & Revenue As is common with an early medical device in an exploratory setting, we have outlined our current pilot/beta test subjects and identified them as key to the development of the Bioptic\u2122 validity in the pathology cytology workflow to attain adequate sample data the first time, every time. Customer and partner interviews Through the customer and industry discovery phase that included interviewing more than 200 recognized clinicians, Pathology thought leaders, and medical professionals across the country, Pathware Inc. learned that there is an immediate need for a device with the capabilities of Bioptic\u2122. With the initial presentation of the product idea, an immediate value was recognized. By far the most mentioned aspect was how much time would be saved for both patient and pathologists, with many of them making mention that being present for quality assessment was not an effective use of their billable time. Several radiologists that were part of the discovery discussed how each pathologist will have a different quantity of passes they will request for each biopsy, to help stave off the possibility of a sample quality issue, a problem that Bioptic\u2122 addresses. A direct quote from Mark Cohen, professor of Surgery and Pharmacology at the University of Michigan Health System \u201cHaving worked with Pathware\u2019s CEO, Michael Moore, over the past few years, the team has undergone rigorous efforts including NSF\u2019s, I-CORPS, and VentureWell programming to validate the need for their technology in the healthcare space. I feel this technology carries great potential clinical merit and am in complete support of evaluating it clinically to determine its benefits to patients and workflow efficiencies.\u201d Positioning/Niche The initial niche is the digital cytology quality assessment. As such, a strong emphasis needs to be placed on positioning Bioptic\u2122 as a device complementary to existing pathologist workflow. It creates unique value over current solutions and integrates with established pathologist and clinician practices. This provides a unique position for Pathware Inc. as once Bioptic\u2122 has been adopted, it can be constantly improved via software updates to increase adoption and functionality. With platform technology, it can perform quality and assessment to many secondary markets (via other tissues) while building a valuable repository from the tissue data collected by Bioptic\u2122. Altogether, the technology allows them to establish a low-cost gold standard for automated quality assessment. International Sales Process International Distributor Flow Chart.pdf Promotional Budget & Pricing At launch, the per month sales and marketing budget will be $30,000 in Oct. 2019 and climb steadily in proportion to revenue of $9MM by the end of 2023. During this, they plan to take the product from a research-based platform to a commercially and clinically viable tool and focus less on passive marketing and more aggressive techniques such as in-person conferences and targeted advertising. Initial marketing activities will focus on key areas discussed below: Trade shows Attendance at industry trade shows to spread awareness of products and connect with potential consumers Thought leaders/Pathology champions Identify Key opinion leaders to provide dinner programs education seminars/round tables at trade shows, conferences, and local seminars. Industry professional testimony Utilize testimony from industry professionals that participated in clinical trials and early adoption in marketing material and literature. Literature ads A recurring round of marketing material will be run in medical journals in Q3 as they enter the market SEO optimization Search Engine Optimization utilizing both internal and external sources to ensure the correct results are visible through search aggregators and those looking for additional information Social media presence Hand in hand with the SEO optimization, a focus on social media consistency keeping Pathware relevant in the new age of digital media. To reiterate, the Bioptic\u2122 unit will be listed at $20,000 (25% volume discount will be offered) giving a 70% margin when factoring in the discount, 90-day full return policy from the date of sale. Once in place, the service of sample assessment will cost $10 per slide scanned to the hospital. Scanning requires no additional resources. Given a reimbursement of $69.21 per pass and an average of 4.5 passes per biopsy, the machine will generate positive revenue for the institution after around 80 biopsy procedures under this pricing strategy. Location Pathware Inc. offices are split between two US locations: Seattle, Washington, and Ann Arbor, Michigan. Both offices are open offices and co-working spaces that offer flexibility for scaling rapidly as their business expands. Ann Arbor A vibrant town buoyed by the academic prowess of the University of Michigan; Ann Arbor is a short drive from a major international airport, providing easy access to the clinical validation partners, primarily based in the East Coast and Midwest. Life Science is a main staple of the midwestern startup scene, which has enabled Pathware to thrive with supportive grants and a vast network of medical resources readily available. The Business Development is located in Ann Arbor due to the proximity to their pilot clinical sites (Michigan Medicine, Henry Ford Health System, UPMC) and ease of access to the major international airport of DTW. Additionally, Ann Arbor has served as the basecamp for Pathware from day one by fostering development through state sponsored grants and its vast network of life science mentors. Throughout the early stages of development it is critical to maintain regular communication and develop professional relationships with the physician champions at the pilot institutions to ensure that our clinical studies are able to successfully flow into early adopters and reference accounts. This office\u2019s focus is on building strong relationships with their initial accounts and making inroads within the entrepreneurial and investment ecosystems to support future growth. Seattle An enormous technology center in the Pacific Northwest whose only rival in the software boom of the past two decades is Silicon Valley; Seattle provides the necessary tech sector and work-life balance to attract their software and related product and service development needs. Pathware\u2019s Technology Development Center located in Seattle, at the epicenter for machine learning and home to a booming software industry. This is strategically located to provide access to skilled workers with the need of technical development for primary assessment algorithm and expansion into developing algorithms for secondary diagnosis/assessment of other aspects (i.e. beyond FNA adequacy assessment). Seattle is a key R&D location for potential partners such as Philips Healthcare. The city is also home to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and the University of Washington, all of which service patients from Alaska to across the Pacific Northwest. The plan is to assemble the initial units in Seattle until agreements are in place for scaling operations with a contract manufacturer. 24-Month Sales Forecast Pathware inc. plans on launching Bioptic\u2122 to selected research partners in March 2020, producing initial revenue of $20,000 in readers and $16,800 in assessment charges. This successful soft launch will put Pathware on schedule to sell 430 units by end of 2021, having been reimbursed for more than 700,000 assessments and generating $41MM in combined revenue.
